## Update Protocol (CRITICAL)

### Two-Document Rule

**We maintain ONLY 2 core documents** to prevent "patchy work" and ensure cohesive narrative.

**Golden Rule**: Before updating ANY content, determine which document owns it:

| Content Type | Document | Reason |
|--------------|----------|--------|
| **Transformation Framework** | Both (Tokenization has full, Platform needs update) | Tokenization Strategy has complete 14 patterns + 840hrs; Platform Vision needs this added |
| **Economic Coordination** | Platform Vision | 7D attribution, match quality weighting, synergy calculation |
| **Network State Partnerships** | Platform Vision | Go-to-market strategy, pilot structure, NS-specific value props |
| **Token Economics** | Tokenization Strategy | Tiers, distribution, capital allocation, revenue model |
| **B2B Case Studies** | Tokenization Strategy | Render, Arweave, Chainlink, Braintrust, Helium patterns |
| **Technical Architecture** | Platform Vision | Microservices, database, blockchain layer |
| **Risk Analysis** | Tokenization Strategy | Token-specific risks and mitigation |
| **Competitive Positioning** | Platform Vision | Moats, flywheels, white space opportunity |

### Update Workflow

**Step 1: Identify Document**
- Platform changes (transformation, coordination, NS strategy) → **GTN-Platform-Vision.md**
- Token changes (economics, tiers, distribution) → **GTN-Tokenization-Strategy.md**

**Step 2: Make Update**
- Edit the identified document ONLY
- Maintain section structure (don't reorganize without reason)
- Preserve existing formatting and style

**Step 3: Cross-Reference Check**
- Does the other document reference this content?
- If yes, add note: "(See [Document] Part X for details)" rather than duplicating
- Example: Platform Vision references token tiers but doesn't duplicate full tokenomics

**Step 4: Consistency Verification**
Run this checklist after ANY update:

**Transformation Framework Consistency**:
- [ ] Both docs agree on Reactive→Responsive→Realized spectrum definition
- [ ] Both docs list same 14 coordination patterns (currently: Tokenization ✅, Platform ❌)
- [ ] Both docs reference 840+ hours content (currently: Tokenization ✅, Platform ❌)
- [ ] Both docs describe AI-enhanced collective evolution (currently: Tokenization ✅, Platform ❌)
- [ ] Both docs include Facilitator economy in Tier 3 (currently: Tokenization ✅, Platform ❌)

**Economic Model Consistency**:
- [ ] Both docs agree on three-tier pricing ($10K, $100K, $166K)
- [ ] Both docs agree on stake requirements (1M, 10M, 50M GTN)
- [ ] Both docs agree on target NS sizes (50-500, 500-5K, 5K-50K)
- [ ] Both docs agree on revenue projections (Year 1: $1.28M, Year 2: $1.9M, Year 3: $3.1M)
- [ ] Both docs agree on path to profitability (Year 3)

**Traction Metrics Consistency**:
- [ ] Both docs cite 158K registrations, 27K paying users, $2M revenue
- [ ] Both docs reference Gallup research (6x engagement, 4x economic effectiveness)
- [ ] Both docs position as B2B infrastructure (not retail token)
- [ ] Both docs emphasize cooperation dynamics (ecosystem, not competitive)

**Strategic Positioning Consistency**:
- [ ] Both docs use "Transformational Coordination Infrastructure" category
- [ ] Both docs emphasize "You don't transform THEN coordinate. You transform BY coordinating."
- [ ] Both docs differentiate from learning platforms, spiritual paths, collaboration tools
- [ ] Both docs position as operating system for conscious communities

### Anti-Patterns (DON'T DO THIS)

❌ **Don't create new documents** without archiving old ones
❌ **Don't duplicate content** across both documents (cross-reference instead)
❌ **Don't update one document** without checking if the other needs alignment
❌ **Don't reorganize** document structure without updating this CLAUDE.md
❌ **Don't create "quick reference" docs** that become outdated satellites

## Git Workflow

### Commit Message Standards

**Format**:
```
[Type] Brief description (50 chars max)

Detailed explanation of changes:
- What was changed
- Why it was changed
- Any breaking changes or migrations needed

Affected documents:
- GTN-Platform-Vision.md (Section X updated)
- GTN-Tokenization-Strategy.md (Part Y modified)
```

**Types**:
- `[UPDATE]` - Content updates to existing sections
- `[ADD]` - New content or sections added
- `[FIX]` - Corrections to errors or inconsistencies
- `[REFACTOR]` - Structural reorganization (rare, document in CLAUDE.md)
- `[ARCHIVE]` - Moving documents to archive
- `[META]` - Updates to this CLAUDE.md file

**Example**:
```
[UPDATE] Add 14 coordination patterns to Platform Vision

Integrated complete transformation framework from Tokenization Strategy:
- Added 14 data-driven coordination patterns (4 coord, 3 resource, 3 comm, 2 leadership, 2 innovation)
- Added 840+ hours content breakdown (5-level journey)
- Added AI-enhanced collective evolution details
- Added Facilitator economy concept

This completes the transformation framework consistency across both docs.

Affected documents:
- GTN-Platform-Vision.md (Part 1 expanded from 100 → 300 lines)
```

### Branch Strategy

**Main Branch**: `main`
- Always production-ready
- Only merge after consistency verification
- Protected from force pushes

**No Feature Branches** (2-document system is simple enough):
- Work directly on main for small updates
- For major changes, create temporary branch, merge quickly

## Common Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Adding a 15th Coordination Pattern

**Workflow**:
1. **Update Tokenization Strategy** Part 2, lines 161-189
   - Add 15th pattern to list
   - Update "14 patterns" → "15 patterns" throughout
   - Update "840+ hours" → "900+ hours" (60 × 15)

2. **Update Platform Vision** Part 1
   - Add 15th pattern (once transformation framework is added)
   - Update counts and totals

3. **Verify Consistency**:
   - [ ] Both docs list same 15 patterns
   - [ ] Both docs reference 900+ hours
   - [ ] Pattern categories still make sense (4 coord, 3 resource, 3 comm, 2 leadership, 3 innovation?)

4. **Commit**:
   ```
   [UPDATE] Add 15th coordination pattern: Efficiency↔Sustainability

   Added new Innovation Pattern discovered from user data:
   - Pattern 15: Efficiency↔Sustainability (Optimization → Balance → Regeneration)
   - Updated total: 14 → 15 patterns
   - Updated content: 840+ → 900+ hours

   Affected documents:
   - GTN-Tokenization-Strategy.md (Part 2, lines 161-189)
   - GTN-Platform-Vision.md (Part 1 - pending transformation framework integration)
   ```

### Scenario 2: Changing Token Tier Pricing

**Workflow**:
1. **Update Tokenization Strategy** Part 2 (Three-tier model section)
   - Modify tier pricing
   - Recalculate revenue projections (Part 7)
   - Update examples throughout

2. **Update Platform Vision** Part 7 (Monetization)
   - Update tier pricing references
   - Maintain cross-reference to Tokenization Strategy for full details

3. **Verify Consistency**:
   - [ ] Both docs show same tier prices
   - [ ] Revenue projections recalculated
   - [ ] NS size targets still appropriate

4. **Commit with business justification**

### Scenario 3: NS Pilot Results Come In

**Workflow**:
1. **Document in Platform Vision** Part 8 (Go-to-Market)
   - Add case study to NS-specific value props
   - Update metrics if validated (e.g., retention improvement)

2. **Update Tokenization Strategy** if metrics change
   - Part 7: Revenue projections (if pilot reveals new data)
   - Part 10: Success metrics (if benchmarks need adjustment)

3. **Commit with evidence**:
   ```
   [UPDATE] Add Próspera pilot results (85% retention validated)

   Próspera 60-day pilot results:
   - 85% retention improvement (vs 60% → 85% projection)
   - 23 high-quality team formations
   - 47 successful collaborations initiated

   Updated claims:
   - Platform Vision Part 8: Added Próspera case study
   - Tokenization Strategy Part 10: Validated retention metric

   Evidence: [link to pilot report]
   ```

---

## Archive Strategy

### What Goes in `/archive`

**Criteria for Archiving**:
- Document is no longer actively maintained
- Content has been absorbed into 2 main docs
- Historical versions for reference only

**Current Archive**:
- `GTN-Master-Vision.md` - Consolidated version (split into Platform + Token docs)
- `GTN-Network-State-Partnership-Strategy.md` - NS content needs to be absorbed into Platform Vision
- `GTN-Tokenization-Executive-Synthesis.md` - Can extract summary from main Tokenization Strategy
- `DOCUMENT-HIERARCHY.md` - No longer needed with 2-doc system

**Archive Naming**: Keep original filename (don't add dates/versions to filename, use git history)

### When to Reference Archive

**Valid Use Cases**:
- Historical context ("How did we get here?")
- Recover accidentally deleted content
- Compare old vs new approach

**Invalid Use Cases**:
- ❌ Extracting content to create new satellite documents
- ❌ Maintaining parallel versions
- ❌ Treating as "alternative source of truth"

---

## Philosophy & Principles

### Why 2 Documents?

**Rationale**:
1. **Separation of Concerns**: Platform strategy vs. token economics serve different audiences
2. **Manageable Size**: Each ~30-50K (readable in one sitting)
3. **Minimal Overlap**: Cross-reference rather than duplicate
4. **Clear Ownership**: Always know which document to update

**Alternative Rejected**:
- 1 document = Too long (>80K unmanageable)
- 3+ documents = "Patchy work" feeling, update burden, consistency risk

### Core Values

**Evidence Over Assumptions**:
- All claims grounded in EVOLUTION.LIFE data (27K users, $2M revenue)
- Gallup research cited (6x engagement, 4x effectiveness)
- No hallucinated features or capabilities

**Cohesive Narrative**:
- "You don't transform THEN coordinate. You transform BY coordinating."
- Consistent positioning: "Transformational Coordination Infrastructure"
- Unified value proposition across all content

**Transformation-First**:
- Transformation framework is CORE differentiator (not afterthought)
- Economic coordination weighted by developmental maturity
- Network states REQUIRE responsive+ humans (not just tools)

## FAQ

**Q: Should I create a new document for [X]?**
A: No. Determine if [X] belongs in Platform Vision or Tokenization Strategy. If neither, it might not belong in this project.

**Q: The document is getting long. Should I split it?**
A: No. Long documents are okay if well-structured. Splitting creates maintenance burden. Use clear sections and table of contents instead.

**Q: I found duplicate content. What do I do?**
A: Remove duplication. Keep content in primary document, add cross-reference in secondary. Use format: "(See [Document] Part X for details)"

**Q: Can I create a "Quick Reference" guide?**
A: No. Quick references become outdated satellites. Instead, improve README.md or add executive summaries to main docs.

**Q: What if I need to share just the transformation framework?**
A: Extract from Tokenization Strategy (which has complete version). Don't create new document.

**Q: Platform Vision and Tokenization Strategy contradict each other. Which wins?**
A: Neither "wins." Fix both to align. Check git history to see which is more recent, verify against EVOLUTION.LIFE data, then update both.
