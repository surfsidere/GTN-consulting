## Archive Folder

Contains superseded strategies and previous iterations:

**Capitalization Strategies (Superseded)**:
- GTN-Tokenization-Strategy.md (original stake-for-access token model, superseded by bootstrap)
- GTN-SaaS-Capitalization-Strategy.md (traditional VC approach, rejected in favor of bootstrap)
- GTN-Community-Ownership-Token-Strategy.md (DAO token exploration, concepts integrated into bootstrap)

**Strategic Documents (Consolidated)**:
- GTN-Master-Vision.md (consolidated version, now split into Platform + Bootstrap docs)
- GTN-Network-State-Partnership-Strategy.md (absorbed into Platform Vision)
- GTN-Tokenization-Executive-Synthesis.md (can extract from Bootstrap Strategy)
- DOCUMENT-HIERARCHY.md (no longer needed with 3-doc structure)

## Update Protocol

**Platform changes** (transformation, coordination, NS strategy):
→ Update **GTN-Platform-Vision.md**

**Capitalization changes** (fundraising, sales, token):
→ Update **GTN-Bootstrap-Capitalization-Strategy.md** ⭐

**Risk/strategy changes** (market approach, portfolio):
→ Update **GTN-Risk-Analysis-Multi-Strategy.md**

**Documents reference each other** but don't duplicate content:
- Platform Vision → References transformation infrastructure (doesn't duplicate cap strategy)
- Bootstrap Strategy → References platform capabilities (doesn't duplicate technical architecture)
- Risk Analysis → References both platform and cap strategy for context
