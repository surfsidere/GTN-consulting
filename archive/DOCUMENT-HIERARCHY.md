# GTN Documentation Hierarchy Guide
## Single Source of Truth + Specialized Views

**Date**: January 2025
**Purpose**: Prevent "patchy work" by establishing clear document relationships and single sources of truth
**Status**: Active Framework

---

## Core Principle

**One Master, Multiple Views**: GTN-Master-Vision.md is the **single source of truth**. All other documents are **specialized derivative views** for specific audiences or purposes.

**Update Protocol**: When updating strategy, vision, or core concepts:
1. **First**: Update GTN-Master-Vision.md (single source of truth)
2. **Then**: Update relevant specialized documents to reflect changes
3. **Never**: Update specialized docs without checking master consistency

---

## Document Architecture

### Tier 1: Master Foundation (Single Source of Truth)

**GTN-Master-Vision.md** (49K words, 1,400 lines)
- **Audience**: Internal team, strategic partners, comprehensive understanding
- **Purpose**: Complete unified narrative integrating all GTN components
- **Scope**: Transformation + Economic Coordination + Token Economics + NS Strategy
- **Update Frequency**: Quarterly or when major strategic shifts occur
- **Sections**:
  1. Executive Summary (Quadruple Value Proposition)
  2. Part 1: Transformation Framework (14 patterns, 840+ hours, AI-enhanced evolution)
  3. Part 2: Economic Coordination Platform (7D attribution, match quality weighting)
  4. Part 3: Token Economics & Business Model (MIDAO, 4-layer utility, $5M raise)
  5. Part 4: Network State Partnership Strategy (ecosystem approach, pilots)
  6. Part 5: Competitive Positioning (moats, flywheels, partnerships)
  7. Part 6: Implementation Roadmap (Phase 0 → Phase 4)
  8. Part 7: Success Metrics & KPIs
  9. Conclusion: The Vision

**Key Insight**: This document contains EVERYTHING. If something isn't here, it's not part of GTN strategy.

---

### Tier 2: Specialized Derivative Documents

These documents are **views** of the master—they pull specific content for particular audiences but should NEVER contradict or extend beyond the master.

#### A. GTN-Tokenization-Strategy.md (46K words, 1,228 lines)

**Source Material**: Part 3 (Token Economics) + Part 1 (Transformation Framework)
**Audience**: Token investors, crypto VCs, NS treasuries considering stake
**Purpose**: Deep dive on tokenization economics, MIDAO structure, and capital strategy
**Specialization**: Heavy emphasis on B2B infrastructure patterns (Render, Arweave, Braintrust)
**When to Use**: Token sale presentations, investor due diligence, economic modeling discussions
**Key Differentiator**: 73 sections on token mechanics, distribution, revenue buybacks

**Relationship to Master**:
- Inherits transformation framework (Part 1, lines 127-291)
- Expands token economics (Part 3 in master becomes full document)
- Includes same three-tier model (Tier 1: $10K, Tier 2: $100K, Tier 3: $166K)

**Update Trigger**: When token economics, distribution, or capital allocation changes

---

#### B. GTN-Tokenization-Executive-Synthesis.md (17K words, 406 lines)

**Source Material**: Condensed version of GTN-Tokenization-Strategy.md
**Audience**: Busy executives, NS founders, quick investment review
**Purpose**: One-page strategic overview for investors/partners
**Specialization**: Ultra-condensed (1/3 the length of full strategy)
**When to Use**: Email attachments, quick pitch decks, executive summaries
**Key Differentiator**: Quadruple Value Proposition emphasized, traction metrics prominent

**Relationship to Master**:
- Inherits transformation overview (79-100)
- Summarizes three-tier model (no detail, just high-level)
- Emphasizes traction (27K users, $2M revenue) more than master

**Update Trigger**: When GTN-Tokenization-Strategy.md changes significantly

---

#### C. GTN-Platform-Vision.md (32K words, 890 lines)

**Source Material**: Part 1 (Transformation) + Part 2 (Economic Coordination) from master
**Audience**: Product team, NS community managers, platform users
**Purpose**: Complete platform capabilities, transformation framework, matching algorithm
**Specialization**: Deep dive on product features, user journey, technical architecture
**When to Use**: Product development, NS integration planning, team onboarding
**Key Differentiator**: Detailed scenario (Alice, Bob, Carol collaboration), technical stack

**Relationship to Master**:
- Currently MISSING 14 patterns detail, 840+ hours breakdown, 5-level journey (NEEDS UPDATE)
- Has Reactive→Responsive→Realized framework (matches master)
- Needs AI-enhanced collective evolution section added

**Update Trigger**: When transformation framework or platform capabilities change

**Action Required**: Add missing transformation framework details from master (Part 1)

---

#### D. GTN-Network-State-Partnership-Strategy.md (20K words, 442 lines)

**Source Material**: Part 4 (NS Strategy) from master
**Audience**: Alejandro (BD lead), NS founders, partnership prospects
**Purpose**: Go-to-market strategy, NS-specific value props, pilot structure
**Specialization**: Ecosystem approach, parallel outreach, Latin America hub integration
**When to Use**: NS partnership conversations, pilot design, BD planning
**Key Differentiator**: Detailed NS intelligence questions, Alejandro/Pavel action items

**Relationship to Master**:
- Currently MISSING transformation framework entirely (NEEDS UPDATE)
- Has ecosystem strategy (matches master Part 4)
- Positioned as "Human-Centered Coordination Layer" (correct but needs transformation depth)

**Update Trigger**: When NS partnership strategy or value propositions change

**Action Required**: Add transformation framework as core value proposition (from master Part 1)

## Update Workflows

### Scenario 1: Major Strategic Shift (e.g., Add New Token Tier)

**Workflow**:
1. **Update Master First**: Add new tier to GTN-Master-Vision.md Part 3
2. **Update Tokenization Docs**: Reflect change in GTN-Tokenization-Strategy.md + Executive Synthesis
3. **Update Platform Vision**: If tier includes new platform features, add to GTN-Platform-Vision.md
4. **Update NS Strategy**: If tier affects partnership approach, update GTN-Network-State-Partnership-Strategy.md
5. **Verify Consistency**: Check all four docs have same tier pricing, features, target NS size

**Example**: If we add "Tier 0: Individual Membership ($100/year)" for solo users:
- Master Part 3 → Add Tier 0 details
- Tokenization Strategy → Add to stake-for-access section
- Platform Vision → Add individual user journey
- NS Strategy → Update to clarify "Network State tiers are separate from individual tier"

---

### Scenario 2: Transformation Framework Evolution (e.g., Add 15th Pattern)

**Workflow**:
1. **Update Master First**: Add 15th pattern to GTN-Master-Vision.md Part 1
2. **Update Tokenization Strategy**: Add to lines 161-189 (14 patterns section)
3. **Update Platform Vision**: Add pattern to assessment capabilities (ONCE transformation framework is added)
4. **Update NS Strategy**: Add pattern to value proposition (ONCE transformation framework is added)
5. **Update Content Calculation**: 840 hours → 900 hours (60 hours × 15 patterns)

**Example**: If we discover "Efficiency ↔ Sustainability" pattern from new user data:
- Master Part 1 → Add to Innovation Patterns section
- All docs → Update "14 patterns" to "15 patterns"
- All docs → Update "840+ hours" to "900+ hours"

---

### Scenario 3: NS Partnership Learning (e.g., Próspera Pilot Results)

**Workflow**:
1. **Document Results**: Add case study to GTN-Network-State-Partnership-Strategy.md
2. **Extract Strategic Insights**: If insights apply to ALL network states, add to master Part 4
3. **Update Value Props**: If results validate new value proposition, add to all docs
4. **Update Metrics**: If KPIs change based on learnings, update master Part 7 + all docs

**Example**: If Próspera pilot shows 85% retention improvement (better than 60% → 85% projection):
- NS Strategy → Add detailed case study
- Master Part 4 → Update retention improvement claim to 85%
- Tokenization docs → Update NS value proposition with validated metric
- Platform Vision → Add Próspera success story

---

## Final Guidance

**Golden Rule**: When in doubt, check **GTN-Master-Vision.md** first. It's the single source of truth.

**Update Order**: Master → Specialized docs (never the reverse)

**Consistency Principle**: If documents conflict, master wins. If master is unclear, update master first, then propagate.

**Anti-Pattern Warning**: Never update a specialized document without checking if the change should be in the master. This prevents "patchy work" where documents diverge over time.

**Success Criteria**: All four documents tell the same cohesive story, just optimized for different audiences. No contradictions, no missing pieces, no surprises.

---

**Document Status**: Active Framework
**Next Review**: After GTN-Platform-Vision.md and GTN-Network-State-Partnership-Strategy.md updates complete
**Owner**: Team-wide responsibility (anyone updating docs should follow this hierarchy)
