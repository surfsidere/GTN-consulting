# GTN SaaS Capitalization & Governance Strategy

**Executive Summary**: Traditional SaaS funding approach with founder governance retention, de-risked go-to-market through validation sprints, and clear path to profitability.

**Status**: Strategic capitalization plan
**Date**: January 2025
**Approach**: Seed → Series A → Optional token launch (Year 3+)

---

## Core Principles

### 1. Governance Retention (Non-Negotiable)

**Founder Control Structure**:
- **Seed Round**: Founders retain 70%+ voting control through dual-class shares
- **Series A**: Founders retain 51%+ voting control (protective provisions accepted)
- **Long-Term**: Maintain strategic decision-making authority through liquidity events

**Rationale**:
- GTN's transformation methodology requires long-term vision (not quarterly optimization)
- EVOLUTION.LIFE's success came from founder-driven product decisions (not investor committees)
- Network state partnerships require authentic alignment (not profit-maximization pressure)

---

### 2. Traditional SaaS Model (Not Token)

**Why SaaS**:
- ✅ Predictable revenue model (MRR/ARR tracking)
- ✅ Lower customer acquisition friction (credit card vs. token custody)
- ✅ Proven investor playbook (SaaS metrics well-understood)
- ✅ Regulatory clarity (no token securities issues)
- ✅ Faster sales cycles (no token education required)

**Token Optionality Preserved**:
- Year 3+ consideration if network effects proven
- Token launch from position of strength ($3-5M ARR)
- Governance token (not stake-for-access) if launched

---

### 3. Risk-Mitigated Go-to-Market

**Validation Before Capital**:
- Month 1-3: Execute validation sprints (DAO, co-living, individual, enterprise)
- Prove demand with $0 pilots and waitlist signups
- Raise capital ONLY after 3/4 validations succeed

**Phased Revenue Strategy**:
- Phase 1 (Months 1-12): Foundation ($150K ARR)
- Phase 2 (Months 13-24): Scale ($515K ARR)
- Phase 3 (Months 25-36): Profitability path ($972K ARR)

---

## Seed Round Structure

### Investment Terms

**Amount**: $2.5M
**Instrument**: Series Seed Preferred Stock
**Valuation**: $7.5M pre-money, $10M post-money
**Dilution**: 25% to investors, 75% retained (60% founders, 15% employee pool)

**Share Structure**:
```
Class A Common (10 votes/share): Founders only
Class B Common (1 vote/share): Employees, advisors
Series Seed Preferred (1 vote/share): Investors

Founder voting power: 60% × 10 votes = 85.7% control
Employee voting power: 15% × 1 vote = 2.1% control
Investor voting power: 25% × 1 vote = 12.2% control
```

**Protective Provisions** (Standard):
- Board seats: 2 founders, 1 investor, 0 independent (investor gets observer rights)
- Approval required for: asset sales >$500K, new equity raises, liquidation preferences changes
- NO approval required for: product decisions, hiring, partnerships, operational matters

---

### Governance Retention Mechanisms

**1. Dual-Class Structure**:
- Class A (10 votes/share) reserved for founders
- Converts to Class B (1 vote/share) upon founder exit
- Maintains founder control through Series A and beyond

**2. Board Composition**:
- Seed: 2 founders, 1 investor observer (no vote)
- Series A: 2 founders, 1 investor, 1 independent (founders retain majority)
- Series B+: 2 founders, 2 investors, 1 independent (founders retain tiebreaker)

**3. Investor Rights Limitations**:
- **NO drag-along rights** (investors cannot force sale)
- **NO participation rights** (no double-dipping on exits)
- **NO liquidation preference >1x** (investors get money back, not 2-3x)
- **NO veto on product roadmap** (founders control product decisions)

**4. Anti-Dilution Protection**:
- Broad-based weighted average (founder-friendly, not full ratchet)
- Protects investors from down-rounds WITHOUT punishing founders

---

### Investor Profile

**Target Investors** (3-5 investors, $500K-1M each):

**Tier 1: Vertical SaaS Specialists** (60% of round):
- Point Nine Capital (European SaaS, B2B marketplaces)
- Boldstart Ventures (enterprise infrastructure, dev tools)
- Uncork Capital (SaaS, marketplace, PLG)

**Tier 3: Strategic Revenue Investors** (10% of round):
- EVOLUTION.LIFE co-investors (already understand transformation methodology)
- **Rationale**: Patient capital, aligned on long-term vision, trust in founders

**Investor Criteria**:
- ✅ Founder-friendly reputation (no hostile board takeovers in portfolio)
- ✅ SaaS expertise (understand ARR, churn, LTV/CAC metrics)
- ✅ Patient capital (3-5 year horizon, not 18-month flip mentality)
- ✅ Value-add beyond capital (customer intros, hiring, strategic guidance)
- ❌ Governance control seekers (pass on investors demanding board majority)
- ❌ Token-only investors (misaligned with SaaS-first approach)

## Use of Funds ($2.5M / 30 months)

### Capital Allocation

| Category | Amount | % | Headcount | Rationale |
|----------|--------|---|-----------|-----------|
| **Engineering** | $1.2M | 48% | 4 engineers | Platform development, DAO integrations, individual marketplace |
| **Sales & Marketing** | $700K | 28% | 3 AEs, 1 CSM, 1 marketing | DAO outreach, co-living partnerships, content marketing |
| **Product & Design** | $400K | 16% | 2 people | Product management, UX/UI design, user research |
| **Operations** | $200K | 8% | 1 ops lead | Finance, legal, HR, tools, compliance |
| **TOTAL** | $2.5M | 100% | 11 people | Lean, focused team |

**Burn Rate**: $2.5M ÷ 30 months = **$83K/month**

---

### Detailed Budget (Monthly)

**Personnel** ($70K/month):
- Engineering: 4 engineers @ $120K salary = $40K/month
- Sales: 3 AEs @ $80K base + $40K commission = $30K/month (includes CSM)
- Product/Design: 2 people @ $100K salary = $17K/month
- Marketing: 1 lead @ $90K salary = $7.5K/month
- Operations: 1 lead @ $80K salary = $7K/month
- **Subtotal**: $101.5K/month (OVER BUDGET - need to optimize)

**Personnel Optimization** ($65K/month):
- Engineering: 3 engineers @ $110K (start with 3, hire 4th at Month 12) = $27.5K/month
- Sales: 2 AEs @ $75K base (hire 3rd at Month 12) = $12.5K/month
- Product/Design: 2 people @ $95K salary = $16K/month
- Marketing: 1 lead @ $85K salary = $7K/month
- Operations: Fractional CFO + tools (no full-time hire) = $2K/month
- **Subtotal**: $65K/month ✅

**Non-Personnel** ($18K/month):
- Infrastructure: AWS, databases, dev tools = $5K/month
- Sales tools: CRM, email, outreach software = $2K/month
- Marketing: Ads, content, events = $5K/month
- Legal & compliance: Contracts, filings = $3K/month
- Office & travel: Co-working, NS events = $3K/month
- **Subtotal**: $18K/month

**Total Monthly Burn**: $65K + $18K = **$83K/month** ✅

**Runway**: $2.5M ÷ $83K = **30 months**

---

### Hiring Plan

**Month 1-3** (Validation Phase):
- Founders only (no hires until validation succeeds)
- Contractors for specific tasks (landing page, pilot support)

**Month 4-6** (Foundation Phase):
- Hire: 2 engineers, 1 product lead, 1 AE
- Team: 6 people (2 founders + 4 hires)
- Burn: ~$50K/month

**Month 7-12** (Early Traction Phase):
- Hire: 1 engineer, 1 designer, 1 AE, 1 CSM, 1 marketing lead
- Team: 11 people (2 founders + 9 hires)
- Burn: $83K/month (full team deployed)

**Month 13-24** (Scale Phase):
- Hire: 1 engineer (4th), 1 AE (3rd), contractors as needed
- Team: 13 people + contractors
- Burn: $90-95K/month (slightly higher with contractors)

**Month 25-30** (Series A Prep):
- Hire: VP Sales, VP Engineering (prepare for scale)

## Risk Mitigation Strategy

### Pre-Funding Validation (Months 1-3)

**Purpose**: De-risk capital raise by proving demand BEFORE asking for money

#### Validation Sprint 1: DAO Market

**Hypothesis**: DAOs will pay $500-1K/month for transformation infrastructure

**Activities**:
1. Research 100 DAOs, segment by size/treasury/governance activity
2. Conduct 20 discovery calls with DAO operators
3. Build lightweight MVP (DAO-specific coordination features)
4. Run 3 pilot DAOs at $0 for 60 days

**Success Criteria**:
- ✅ 15/20 calls confirm coordination pain points (75% validation rate)
- ✅ 2/3 pilots willing to pay $500/month after trial (67% conversion)
- ✅ Identify 10 DAOs ready to buy in Month 4-6 (pipeline proof)

**Investment Needed**: $0 (founder time only)

**Decision**:
- If SUCCESS → Include in seed pitch as proven demand
- If FAILURE → Pivot to co-living/individual focus, reduce DAO allocation

---

#### Validation Sprint 2: Co-living Communities

**Hypothesis**: Co-living communities will pay $200-500/month for coordination tools

**Activities**:
1. Partner outreach to Cabin, Radish, Outsite
2. Cabin pilot in 1 neighborhood (20-50 residents)
3. Expand to 3-5 Cabin neighborhoods if pilot succeeds
4. Measure resident engagement, NPS, Cabin's willingness to pay

**Success Criteria**:
- ✅ Cabin commits to pilot (LOI signed)
- ✅ 3/5 neighborhoods show 60%+ resident engagement
- ✅ Cabin expresses interest in $500/month for 10+ neighborhoods

**Investment Needed**: $0-2K (pilot support, minimal travel)

**Decision**:
- If SUCCESS → Include in seed pitch with Cabin LOI as proof
- If FAILURE → Reduce co-living allocation, focus on DAOs/individual

---

#### Validation Sprint 3: Individual Platform

**Hypothesis**: 500+ individuals will sign up for community-finding waitlist in 60 days

**Activities**:
1. Build landing page ($500 via Webflow/Framer)
2. Content marketing (blog posts, Twitter threads, NS partnerships)
3. Targeted ads ($2K budget to NS/co-living audiences)
4. User interviews with 50+ waitlist signups

**Success Criteria**:
- ✅ 500+ waitlist signups in 60 days (<$5 CAC)
- ✅ 50+ user interviews confirm community-finding pain point
- ✅ 10+ communities willing to list on platform

**Investment Needed**: $2.5K (landing page $500 + ads $2K)

**Decision**:
- If SUCCESS → Include in seed pitch with 500 signups as traction
- If FAILURE → Skip individual platform, reallocate to B2B strategies

---

#### Validation Sprint 4: Enterprise B2B2C

**Hypothesis**: Tech startups will pay $500-1K/month for team transformation programs

**Activities**:
1. Develop enterprise pitch deck (white-label EVOLUTION.LIFE IP)
2. Pitch to 5 companies (50-200 employees, remote-first)
3. Run 1 pilot program with 50-100 employees

**Success Criteria**:
- ✅ 2/5 companies interested in pilot (40% conversion)
- ✅ 1 pilot company commits (LOI signed)
- ✅ 60%+ employee engagement in pilot program

**Investment Needed**: $0 (leverage existing EVOLUTION.LIFE content)

**Decision**:
- If SUCCESS → Include in seed pitch with LOI as proof
- If FAILURE → Skip enterprise strategy, focus on DAO/co-living

---

### Overall Validation Framework

**Scenario A: 4/4 Validations Succeed** (HIGH CONFIDENCE)
- Raise $2.5M seed with proof across all strategies
- Pitch: "We validated 4 customer segments with $0 spent, here's the data"
- Investor confidence: 80%+ (multiple paths to $1M ARR proven)

**Scenario B: 3/4 Validations Succeed** (MODERATE CONFIDENCE)
- Raise $2M seed, focus on 3 successful strategies
- Pitch: "We validated 3 of 4 segments, here's why we're focusing on winners"
- Investor confidence: 70%+ (diversified approach with proven demand)

**Scenario C: 2/4 Validations Succeed** (LOW CONFIDENCE)
- Raise $1.5M seed, focus on 2 successful strategies only
- Pitch: "We found 2 strong markets, here's our focused approach"
- Investor confidence: 60%+ (narrower but validated)

**Scenario D: 0-1 Validations Succeed** (PIVOT REQUIRED)
- Do NOT raise capital for GTN
- Return to EVOLUTION.LIFE, explore different B2B approach
- Revisit GTN in 12 months with new strategy

---

### Post-Funding Risk Mitigation

#### Risk 1: Slower-than-Expected Sales Cycles

**Mitigation**:
- **Assumption**: 3-6 month sales cycles for DAOs
- **Buffer**: Model 6-9 month cycles (50% longer than expected)
- **Trigger**: If Month 6 shows <5 paying customers → Accelerate co-living/individual (faster cycles)
- **Action**: Shift sales resources to faster-converting segments

---

#### Risk 2: Customer Concentration (Over-Reliance on One Segment)

**Mitigation**:
- **Diversification Target**: No single segment >60% of revenue
- **Monitoring**: Monthly revenue breakdown by segment (DAO, co-living, individual, enterprise)
- **Trigger**: If DAOs >70% of revenue at Month 12 → Double-down on diversification
- **Action**: Hire specialist AEs for underperforming segments

---

#### Risk 3: EVOLUTION.LIFE Cannibalization

**Mitigation**:
- **Monitoring**: Track EVOLUTION.LIFE churn rate monthly (baseline: pre-GTN launch)
- **Trigger**: If churn increases >10% after GTN Individual launch → Pause marketing
- **Action**: Investigate cause (cannibalization vs. market conditions), adjust positioning
- **Separation Strategy**: Different brands, different marketing channels, different use cases

---

#### Risk 4: Capital Exhaustion Before Series A

**Mitigation**:
- **Runway Monitoring**: Weekly cash tracking, 12-month forward projections
- **Series A Timing**: Begin fundraising at Month 18-20 (not Month 24-27) if burn accelerating
- **Bridge Options**: $500K bridge from existing investors if Series A delayed
- **Burn Reduction**: Cut non-essential spend if runway drops below 9 months

---

#### Risk 5: Product-Market Fit Takes Longer than Expected

**Mitigation**:
- **Monthly PMF Assessment**: Track NPS, retention, expansion revenue
- **Trigger**: If Month 12 NPS <30 or retention <70% → Product pivot required
- **Action**: Customer interviews (20+ in-depth), feature prioritization reset
- **Founder Flexibility**: Reserve 20% of engineering capacity for rapid iteration

## Revenue Model & Path to Profitability

### 30-Month Revenue Targets

| Segment | Month 12 ARR | Month 24 ARR | Month 30 ARR | Customers (M30) |
|---------|--------------|--------------|--------------|-----------------|
| DAO-First B2B | $90K | $315K | $600K | 50 DAOs |
| Co-living Communities | $7.2K | $28.8K | $72K | 12 communities |
| GTN Individual | $34.8K | $108K | $180K | 500 users |
| Enterprise B2B2C | $18K | $63K | $120K | 10 companies |
| **TOTAL** | **$150K** | **$515K** | **$972K** | **572 customers** |

### Unit Economics (Blended)

**Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC)**:
- DAO: $5K (high-touch sales, 3-6 month cycles)
- Co-living: $3K (partnership-driven, lower friction)
- Individual: $50 (product-led growth, viral loops)
- Enterprise: $8K (complex sales, pilot required)
- **Blended CAC**: ~$2.5K (weighted by customer mix)

**Lifetime Value (LTV)**:
- DAO: $18K (3 years × $500/month × 12 months, 85% retention)
- Co-living: $9K (3 years × $250/month × 12 months, 75% retention)
- Individual: $540 (18 months × $30/month, 60% retention)
- Enterprise: $21K (3 years × $583/month × 12 months, 80% retention)
- **Blended LTV**: ~$8K (weighted by customer mix)

**LTV/CAC Ratio**: $8K ÷ $2.5K = **3.2x** ✅ (target: >3x)

**CAC Payback Period**:
- DAO: 10 months ($5K ÷ $500/month)
- Co-living: 12 months ($3K ÷ $250/month)
- Individual: 2 months ($50 ÷ $30/month)
- Enterprise: 14 months ($8K ÷ $583/month)
- **Blended**: ~9 months ✅ (target: <12 months)

---

### Path to Profitability

**Month 30 Financial Model**:

**Revenue**: $972K ARR ÷ 12 = $81K MRR

**Expenses** (at scale):
- Personnel (15 people): $110K/month
- Infrastructure & tools: $8K/month
- Sales & marketing: $7K/month
- Operations: $5K/month
- **Total Expenses**: $130K/month

**Profitability**: $81K - $130K = **-$49K/month** (not yet profitable)

**Break-Even**: ~$1.56M ARR (at current expense structure)

**Series A Target**: Raise $5-8M to scale to $3-5M ARR (profitable at $5M+ ARR)

---

### Series A Positioning (Month 24-30)

**Raise Amount**: $5-8M
**Valuation**: $25-40M pre-money (based on $515K ARR at Month 24, 50-80x ARR multiple)
**Use of Funds**:
- $3M: Sales & marketing (hire 5 AEs, expand to 150+ customers)
- $2M: Engineering (scale platform, improve AI, build enterprise features)
- $2M: Operations & infrastructure (finance, legal, HR, tools)
- $1M: Contingency (18 months runway at $333K/month burn)

**Traction Metrics for Series A**:
- ✅ $500K+ ARR (ideally $750K+)
- ✅ 100+ paying customers across 3+ segments
- ✅ 85%+ net revenue retention (expansion > churn)
- ✅ <$3K blended CAC, >3x LTV/CAC
- ✅ Clear path to $5M ARR within 24 months post-Series A

**Governance at Series A**:
- Board: 2 founders, 2 investors, 1 independent
- Founder voting: 51%+ control retained (Class A shares)
- Investor rights: Standard protective provisions, NO drag-along

---

## Token Optionality (Year 3+)

**When to Consider Token Launch**:

**GREEN LIGHT Criteria** (ALL must be met):
1. **Platform Utility Proven**: $3-5M ARR, 200+ organizational customers
2. **Network Effects Demonstrable**: AI improving with scale, cross-org collaboration proven
3. **Regulatory Clarity**: Token classification clear, compliance path established
4. **Team Capability**: Successfully scaled SaaS to profitability, have crypto expertise
5. **Strategic Value**: Token creates defensible moat (not just fundraising mechanism)

**Token Launch Strategy** (if GREEN):
- **Token Type**: Governance token (not stake-for-access)
- **Use Case**: Cross-platform reputation, multi-org coordination, community governance
- **Raise Size**: $10-20M at $100M+ valuation (position of strength)
- **Allocation**: 15% sold to investors, 85% retained (team, treasury, community rewards)

**RED LIGHT Criteria** (Any triggers NO token):
- Platform not profitable or approaching profitability
- No clear token utility beyond payment
- Regulatory uncertainty persists
- Team lacks crypto/web3 expertise

**Default Path**: Remain SaaS, pursue traditional Series B/C, IPO or acquisition exit

---

## Founder Equity & Vesting

### Founder Allocation

**Total Founder Equity**: 60% of company post-seed

**Split** (example, adjust based on actual founder agreement):
- Founder 1 (Alejandro - Market/Partnerships): 35%
- Founder 2 (Pavel - Product/Tech): 25%
- **Total**: 60%

**Vesting Schedule**:
- 4-year vesting with 1-year cliff
- 25% vests after Year 1 (cliff)
- Remaining 75% vests monthly over Years 2-4
- **Acceleration**: Single-trigger on acquisition (100% vests if company sold)

**Rationale**:
- Aligns founder incentives with long-term company building
- Protects investors if founder leaves early (unvested shares return to pool)
- Acceleration protects founders from acquirer forcing re-vest

---

### Employee Pool

**Size**: 15% of company post-seed (enough for 20-30 early employees)

**Allocation Strategy**:
- **Engineering**: 60% of pool (critical hires, 0.5-2% each)
- **Sales**: 20% of pool (AEs/CSM, 0.25-1% each)
- **Product/Design**: 10% of pool (0.5-1.5% each)
- **Operations**: 10% of pool (0.25-0.75% each)

**Vesting**: 4-year with 1-year cliff (standard)

**Refresh**: Top up pool to 10-15% at Series A (from founder dilution, not new shares)

---

## Exit Scenarios & Returns

### Scenario A: Acquisition Exit (Most Likely)

**Timeline**: Year 5-7
**Acquirer**: Salesforce, HubSpot, Notion, Discord, Slack (collaboration/coordination platforms)
**Valuation**: $100-300M (based on $10-30M ARR at 10x revenue multiple)

**Returns**:
- Seed Investors ($2.5M at $10M post): 25% × $150M = $37.5M → **15x return**
- Series A Investors ($6M at $35M post): 15% × $150M = $22.5M → **3.75x return**
- Founders (60% → 45% post-Series A): 45% × $150M = **$67.5M** ($33.75M each)

---

### Scenario B: IPO Exit (Ambitious)

**Timeline**: Year 7-10
**Market**: NASDAQ, $500M+ valuation required for IPO viability
**Valuation**: $500M-1B (based on $50-100M ARR at 10x revenue multiple)

**Returns**:
- Seed Investors: 25% × 20% (post-dilution) = 5% × $750M = $37.5M → **15x return**
- Series A Investors: 15% × 60% (post-dilution) = 9% × $750M = $67.5M → **11x return**
- Founders: 45% × 50% (post-dilution) = 22.5% × $750M = **$168.75M** ($84M each)

---

### Scenario C: Token Launch Exit (Optional)

**Timeline**: Year 3-5 (if GREEN criteria met)
**Mechanism**: Token sale creates liquidity event for founders/investors
**Valuation**: $200-500M (based on token market cap, highly speculative)

**Structure**:
- Company remains private, token trades publicly
- Founders/investors can sell tokens (not equity) for partial liquidity
- Retain governance control through equity ownership

**Returns**:
- Depends on token market performance (highly variable)
- Not the primary exit strategy (optionality only)

---

## Summary & Recommendations

### Strategic Recommendation

**PROCEED with SaaS-first approach** preserving founder governance and de-risking GTM through validation sprints.

**Why This Reduces Risk**:
1. **Governance Retained**: Founders maintain 70%+ voting control through dual-class shares
2. **Traditional Funding**: SaaS model proven, investor playbook well-understood
3. **Validation-First**: Prove demand BEFORE raising capital (3/4 segments validated)
4. **Diversified Revenue**: 4 customer segments reduce single-point failure risk
5. **Capital Efficient**: $2.5M for 30 months vs. $5M for 18 months (longer runway)
6. **Token Optionality**: Can launch token from strength (Year 3+) if network effects proven

**Expected Outcome** (Base Case):
- 30-Month ARR: $972K (range: $500K-1.2M)
- Customers: 572 across 4 segments
- Series A Raise: $5-8M at $25-40M valuation
- Founder Control: 51%+ voting through Series A and beyond

**Governance Non-Negotiables**:
- ✅ Dual-class shares (Class A 10 votes/share for founders)
- ✅ Board majority through Series A (2 founders, 1 investor, 1 independent max)
- ✅ NO drag-along rights (investors cannot force sale)
- ✅ NO participation rights (no double-dipping on exits)
- ✅ NO product veto (founders control roadmap)

### Next Steps (Weeks 1-12)

**Week 1-4**:
- [ ] Execute DAO validation sprint (20 discovery calls, 3 pilot commitments)
- [ ] Execute co-living validation sprint (Cabin partnership, 1 neighborhood pilot)
- [ ] Execute individual validation sprint (landing page, 500 waitlist signups)
- [ ] Execute enterprise validation sprint (5 company pitches, 1 pilot commitment)

**Week 5-8**:
- [ ] Assess validation results (3/4 succeed = proceed to fundraising)
- [ ] Finalize seed pitch deck with validation data
- [ ] Build financial model (5-year projections, unit economics)
- [ ] Prepare data room (customer interviews, competitive analysis, market sizing)

**Week 9-12**:
- [ ] Investor outreach (20 VCs, target 5-7 interested)
- [ ] First pitch meetings (share deck, gather feedback)
- [ ] Iterate pitch based on investor questions
- [ ] Target: 2-3 term sheets by Week 12

**Decision Point (Month 3)**:
- If 3/4 validations succeed → Proceed to seed fundraising ($2.5M target)
- If 2/4 validations succeed → Raise smaller round ($1.5M), focus on 2 segments
- If 0-1 validations succeed → Do NOT raise, return to EVOLUTION.LIFE, revisit in 12 months
