name: strategic-copywriting
description: This skill should be used when creating strategic brand messaging, persuasive sales copy, or marketing content that requires establishing brand DNA (mission, vision, core values), constructing a StoryBrand narrative architecture (SB7 framework), and generating copy using classical formulas (PAS, BAB, AIDA, 4Ps) aligned to brand voice archetypes. Activate when user requests copywriting with strategic foundation, mentions StoryBrand/Donald Miller, or needs to translate brand strategy into tactical messaging.

# Strategic Copywriting Skill
## The Alchemist's Codex Methodology

**Foundation**: Effective communication is the output of a clearly defined core identity. This skill guides copywriting through three sequential phases: Strategic Foundation → Narrative Engine → Tactical Execution.

**Core Principle**: Sell transformation, not products. The customer is the hero; the brand is the guide.

---

## Operating Principles

### 1. Strategy First
Begin by analyzing and distilling the foundational essence of the business before writing any copy. Never proceed to tactical execution without completing strategic foundation.

### 2. Customer-as-Hero Framework
In all narratives, position the customer as the hero and the brand as the wise mentor. Filter all copy to replace "brand-as-hero" language with "customer-as-hero" language.

**Example Transformation**:
- ❌ Brand-as-Hero: "We are the leading provider of..."
- ✅ Customer-as-Hero: "You deserve a partner who..."

### 3. Inside-Out Approach
All communication stems from the company's non-negotiable mission, vision, and core values. Discover these values through inquiry; do not invent them.

### 4. Clarity Over Cleverness
Make complex ideas simple. Communicate the core message with abundant clarity. Use analogies and metaphors as strategic tools to reduce cognitive load and reinforce brand voice.

### 5. Narrative Architecture
Structure all persuasive communication using story frameworks that place the customer at the center of a compelling journey.

### 6. Ethical Persuasion
Integrate Cialdini's principles of influence (Reciprocity, Consistency, Social Proof, Authority, Liking, Scarcity, Unity) as fundamental components of the brand's story, not as manipulative tactics.

### 7. Medium Adaptation
Adapt the core message to the specific constraints and narrative role of each digital channel.

---

## Phase 1: Strategic Foundation (Information Gathering)

**Purpose**: Function as a brand strategist to establish foundational elements before any copywriting.

**Protocol**: Ask the following questions sequentially. Do not proceed to Phase 2 until all answers are collected.

### 1.1 Brand DNA Discovery

**Mission Inquiry**:
"What is the brand's fundamental purpose beyond profit? Describe the change you're trying to create in the world."

**Validation Criteria**: Answer must be aspirational, specific, and action-oriented. Reject generic statements like "help people" or "make the world better."

---

**Vision Inquiry**:
"What is the aspirational future state you are trying to create? If the mission succeeds completely, what does the world look like in 5-10 years?"

**Validation Criteria**: Answer must paint a vivid, measurable picture of transformation. Avoid vague language.

---

**Core Values Inquiry**:
"What are the 3-5 guiding principles that dictate behavior and decision-making? Push beyond clichés like 'honest' or 'reliable' to uncover unique, ownable descriptors."

**Validation Criteria**: Values must be:
- Specific enough to guide decisions (e.g., "Rigorous" vs. "Quality")
- Ownable to this brand (not generic industry standards)
- Behavioral (they inform HOW you operate, not just WHAT you believe)

**Grounding Reference**: See `references/brand-dna-template.md` for discovery framework.

---

### 1.2 Audience & Competition Analysis

**Target Audience Inquiry**:
"Describe the ideal customer. Go beyond demographics to include:
- Primary pain points and frustrations
- Goals and aspirations (both stated and unstated)
- The specific language and metaphors they use
- Their current state vs. desired state"

**Validation Criteria**: Answer must include psychographic depth, not just demographic data.

---

**Competitor Analysis Inquiry**:
"Who are the main competitors, and what is their core messaging? What gaps or opportunities for differentiation exist in the market?"

**Validation Criteria**: Identify specific messaging gaps, not just feature differences.

---

### 1.3 Offer Clarification

**Product/Service Inquiry**:
"What, specifically, is being sold? Describe the core offering and its primary transformation."

**Success Metrics Inquiry**:
"How will we measure whether this copy succeeds? Define specific, measurable success criteria."

---

**Phase 1 Completion Checkpoint**:
Before proceeding to Phase 2, confirm:
- [ ] Mission is aspirational and specific
- [ ] Vision paints measurable future state
- [ ] Core Values are unique and behavioral
- [ ] Target Audience includes psychographic depth
- [ ] Competitor gaps are identified
- [ ] Offer transformation is clear
- [ ] Success metrics are defined

---

## Phase 2: Narrative Engine (Message Architecture)

**Purpose**: Construct the core narrative architecture using the StoryBrand 7-Part (SB7) Framework before writing any tactical copy.

**Protocol**: Build a "BrandScript" using the framework below. Present this to the user for approval before Phase 3.

**Grounding Reference**: See `references/storybrand-sb7-framework.md` for complete framework details.

---

### StoryBrand 7-Part Framework

#### 2.1 A Character (The Hero)
**Purpose**: Identify the customer's singular, specific desire that drives the narrative.

**Instructions**: Define what the customer wants in simple, concrete terms. This desire must be:
- Specific and tangible
- Relevant to survival, relationships, or meaning
- Expressed in customer language, not brand jargon

**Example**: "A small business owner wants to attract more qualified leads without expensive advertising."

---

#### 2.2 Has a Problem (The Villain)
**Purpose**: Define the three-dimensional problem preventing the hero from getting what they want.

**Instructions**: Articulate the problem at three levels:

**External Problem**: The tangible, surface-level obstacle.
Example: "Struggling to generate consistent leads"

**Internal Problem**: The frustration or self-doubt caused by the external problem.
Example: "Feeling overwhelmed and questioning competence"

**Philosophical Problem**: The deeper injustice or wrongness.
Example: "It shouldn't be this hard for good businesses to thrive"

**Validation**: The Internal Problem is the true story driver. Ensure it resonates emotionally.

---

#### 2.3 And Meets a Guide (The Brand)
**Purpose**: Position the brand as the wise mentor who helps the hero, not the hero themselves.

**Instructions**: Demonstrate two qualities:

**Empathy**: Show understanding of the hero's problem.
Example: "We know how frustrating it is when..."

**Authority**: Provide evidence of competence without arrogance.
Example: "After helping 500+ businesses, we've learned..."

**Validation**: Language must shift from "We are amazing" to "We understand you."

---

#### 2.4 Who Gives Them a Plan (The Path Forward)
**Purpose**: Provide a simple, clear 3-4 step plan that reduces the perceived risk and complexity.

**Instructions**: Create either:

**Process Plan**: Steps the customer takes after purchase
Example: "1. Schedule consultation 2. Receive custom strategy 3. Implement with support"

**Agreement Plan**: Principles that alleviate fears
Example: "No long-term contracts. Cancel anytime. Money-back guarantee."

**Validation**: Plan must reduce customer anxiety and friction.

---

#### 2.5 And Calls Them to Action (The Invitation)
**Purpose**: Define both direct and transitional calls to action.

**Instructions**: Create two CTAs:

**Direct CTA**: The primary, high-commitment action.
Example: "Schedule Your Free Strategy Session"

**Transitional CTA**: The lower-commitment entry point.
Example: "Download Our Free Lead Generation Checklist"

**Validation**: Direct CTA must be clear and prominent. Transitional CTA must provide value.

---

#### 2.6 That Helps Them Avoid Failure (The Stakes)
**Purpose**: Clearly state the negative consequences of inaction to create urgency.

**Instructions**: Answer: "What does the hero's life look like if they don't take action?"

**Example**: "Without a consistent lead generation system, you'll continue burning time on ineffective tactics, watching competitors grow while you plateau."

**Validation**: Stakes must be specific and emotionally resonant, not fear-mongering.

---

#### 2.7 And Ends in a Success (The Transformation)
**Purpose**: Paint a vivid, aspirational picture of the hero's transformed life after success.

**Instructions**: Answer: "What does the hero's life look like after the transformation?"

Use **BAB (Before-After-Bridge)** to structure:
- **Before**: Current frustrated state
- **After**: Aspirational transformed state
- **Bridge**: How the brand facilitates transformation

**Example**: "Imagine waking up to a calendar full of qualified leads, knowing your business is growing predictably while you focus on what you love."

**Validation**: Success vision must be emotionally compelling and specific.

---

### BrandScript Presentation Format

Present the completed BrandScript using this structure:

```
## BrandScript for [Brand Name]

**1. Character (Customer Desire)**:
[Customer's singular want]

**2. Problem**:
- External: [Tangible obstacle]
- Internal: [Emotional frustration]
- Philosophical: [Deeper injustice]

**3. Guide (Brand Position)**:
- Empathy: [Understanding statement]
- Authority: [Credibility evidence]

**4. Plan**:
[3-4 step process or agreement plan]

- Direct CTA: [High-commitment action]
- Transitional CTA: [Low-commitment entry]

**6. Failure (Stakes)**:
[Consequence of inaction]

**7. Success (Transformation)**:
[Aspirational future state]
```

**Phase 2 Completion Checkpoint**:
Before proceeding to Phase 3, confirm:
- [ ] User has reviewed and approved BrandScript
- [ ] All 7 components are complete and specific
- [ ] Internal Problem resonates emotionally
- [ ] Success vision is compelling and clear

**Grounding Asset**: Use `assets/brandscript-template.md` for user completion.

---

## Phase 3: Tactical Execution (Copy Generation)

**Purpose**: Generate specific copy using the established Strategy (Phase 1) and Narrative (Phase 2).

**Protocol**: For every piece of copy generated, follow this four-step process:

---

### 3.1 Formula Declaration

**Instruction**: State which classical copywriting formula is being used and explain why it's the optimal choice for the specific goal.

**Available Formulas** (see `references/copywriting-formulas.md` for details):

**PAS (Problem-Agitate-Solution)**:
- **Use for**: Articulating the Problem section of BrandScript
- **Structure**:
  1. Problem: State the issue clearly
  2. Agitate: Amplify emotional impact
  3. Solution: Present brand as guide

**BAB (Before-After-Bridge)**:
- **Use for**: Articulating the Success section of BrandScript
- **Structure**:
  1. Before: Current frustrated state
  2. After: Aspirational transformed state
  3. Bridge: How brand facilitates transformation

**AIDA (Attention-Interest-Desire-Action)**:
- **Use for**: Full sales pages, landing pages, email sequences
- **Structure**:
  1. Attention: Hook with compelling headline
  2. Interest: Develop curiosity
  3. Desire: Build emotional want
  4. Action: Clear CTA

**4Ps (Promise-Picture-Proof-Push)**:
- **Use for**: Building out Guide, Success, and CTA sections
- **Structure**:
  1. Promise: Bold benefit statement
  2. Picture: Visualize transformation
  3. Proof: Evidence of authority
  4. Push: Compelling CTA

---

**Formula Announcement Template**:
```
**Formula Selected**: [Formula Name]

**Rationale**: [Why this formula is optimal for this specific copy goal]

**Goal Alignment**: [How this formula supports the BrandScript narrative arc]
```

---

### 3.2 Voice Alignment to Values

**Instruction**: Explicitly connect word choices to the Core Values defined in Phase 1.

**Grounding Reference**: See `references/voice-archetype-matrix.md` for Core Value → Linguistic Rule mappings.

**Core Value Translation Examples**:

**Value: "Rigorous"**
- Linguistic Rules: Shorter sentences, declarative structure, data-driven claims
- Example: "47% more qualified leads. Proven in 90 days."

**Value: "Playful"**
- Linguistic Rules: Conversational tone, emojis, pop culture references
- Example: "Ready to turn lead gen from 😩 to 🚀?"

**Value: "Empowering"**
- Linguistic Rules: Second-person active voice, agency-giving language
- Example: "You'll master the exact system that..."

**Validation Protocol**:
After drafting copy, annotate specific word choices:
```
[Copy excerpt] → Reflects [Core Value] through [Linguistic technique]
```

---

### 3.3 Strategic Analogy Integration

**Instruction**: When the concept is complex, introduce an analogy or metaphor to simplify it. The analogy must align with the brand's voice archetype.

**Voice Archetype → Analogy Type Matrix**:

**Sage/Expert Voice**:
- Use: Scientific analogies, historical references, academic frameworks
- Example: "Lead generation is like compound interest—small daily actions create exponential results."

**Jester Voice**:
- Use: Pop culture references, playful comparisons, everyday humor
- Example: "Bad leads are like bad Tinder matches—lots of swipes, zero chemistry."

**Hero Voice**:
- Use: Sports metaphors, competition frameworks, achievement language
- Example: "Building a lead pipeline is like training for a marathon—consistency beats intensity."

**Caregiver Voice**:
- Use: Nurturing metaphors, growth analogies, relationship language
- Example: "Lead nurturing is like tending a garden—water consistently, harvest abundantly."

**Validation**: Analogy must reduce cognitive load, not add complexity.

---

### 3.4 Post-Generation Validation

**Instruction**: After generating copy, run this validation checklist:

**Alignment Verification**:
- [ ] Copy reflects Mission (purpose beyond profit)
- [ ] Copy supports Vision (aspirational future)
- [ ] Word choices align with Core Values (linguistic rules followed)
- [ ] Customer is positioned as hero (not brand-centric)

**Formula Adherence**:
- [ ] Declared formula structure is followed
- [ ] Formula choice matches content goal
- [ ] Formula supports BrandScript narrative arc

**Cialdini Principle Integration**:
- [ ] Identify which principles are integrated: Reciprocity / Consistency / Social Proof / Authority / Liking / Scarcity / Unity
- [ ] Verify principles are woven into narrative, not manipulative tactics

**Analogy Effectiveness**:
- [ ] Analogy simplifies complex concept
- [ ] Analogy aligns with voice archetype
- [ ] Analogy is fresh (not cliché)

**Clarity Test**:
- [ ] 8th-grade reading level or below (use readability tools)
- [ ] No jargon unless target audience uses it
- [ ] One clear idea per sentence

---

## Copy Generation Workflow

**Step-by-Step Execution**:

1. **Receive Specific Copy Request**
   Example: "Write a homepage headline and subheadline"

2. **Announce Formula Selection**
   ```
   **Formula Selected**: AIDA (Attention-Interest)
   **Rationale**: Homepage headline must capture attention immediately, then build interest to drive scroll.
   **Goal Alignment**: Headline surfaces Character's Desire; subheadline hints at Problem.
   ```

3. **Draft Copy with Value Annotations**
   ```
   **Headline**: "Generate Qualified Leads Without Wasting Ad Budget"
   → Reflects "Efficient" core value through direct benefit language

   **Subheadline**: "Join 500+ small businesses using our proven 3-step system to attract dream clients organically."
   → Reflects "Proven" core value through social proof + specificity
   ```

4. **Integrate Strategic Analogy (if needed)**
   ```
   **Analogy**: Lead generation funnel as "magnetic field"—attracts right-fit prospects naturally
   → Sage archetype: Scientific metaphor simplifies complex system
   ```

5. **Run Validation Checklist**
   ```
   ✅ Mission-aligned: Purpose is to help small businesses thrive
   ✅ Customer-as-hero: "You generate" not "We generate for you"
   ✅ AIDA structure: Headline = Attention, Subheadline = Interest
   ✅ Cialdini principles: Social Proof (500+ businesses), Authority (proven system)
   ✅ Clarity: 7th-grade reading level, no jargon
   ```

6. **Present Final Copy with Annotations**

---

## Advanced Techniques

### Channel-Specific Adaptation

**Email Subject Lines**:
- Formula: PAS (condensed)
- Character limit: 50 characters max
- Goal: Drive open rate through curiosity or urgency

**Social Media Posts**:
- Formula: BAB (micro-version)
- Hook first line (3-5 words)
- CTA in first comment (algorithm optimization)

**Landing Pages**:
- Formula: AIDA (full structure)
- Above fold: Attention (headline) + Interest (subheadline)
- Mid-page: Desire (success vision + social proof)
- Bottom: Action (CTA with reduced friction)

**Email Sequences**:
- Email 1: PAS (establish problem)
- Email 2: BAB (show transformation)
- Email 3: 4Ps (authority + CTA)

---

### Iterative Refinement Protocol

**When copy doesn't resonate**:

1. **Revisit Phase 1**: Verify Core Values are accurately captured
2. **Audit BrandScript**: Check if Internal Problem truly resonates
3. **Test Alternative Formula**: Try different formula for same goal
4. **Simplify Analogy**: If analogy adds confusion, remove it
5. **Increase Specificity**: Replace vague language with concrete details

**Example**:
- ❌ Vague: "Grow your business faster"
- ✅ Specific: "Add 15 qualified leads per week in 60 days"

---

## Quality Standards

### Non-Negotiable Requirements

**Every piece of generated copy must**:
1. Position customer as hero (brand as guide)
2. Stem from Mission/Vision/Values established in Phase 1
3. Follow declared copywriting formula structure
4. Use analogies aligned with voice archetype
5. Pass clarity test (8th-grade reading level)
6. Include validation checklist completion

**Copy is incomplete without**:
- Formula declaration + rationale
- Core Value → word choice annotations
- Post-generation validation checklist

---

## Error Prevention

### Common Copywriting Failures (Avoid These)

**Failure 1: Brand-as-Hero Positioning**
- ❌ "We are the industry leader with 20 years of innovation..."
- ✅ "You deserve a partner who's spent 20 years perfecting..."

**Failure 2: Feature Dumping Without Transformation**
- ❌ "Our platform includes CRM, email automation, and analytics..."
- ✅ "Imagine knowing exactly which leads to call, when to call them, and what to say..."

**Failure 3: Vague Core Values**
- ❌ "We value integrity and excellence"
- ✅ "We value Radical Transparency and Relentless Iteration"

**Failure 4: Skipping Strategic Foundation**
- ❌ Writing headlines before understanding Mission
- ✅ Complete Phase 1 → Phase 2 → Phase 3 sequentially

**Failure 5: Manipulative Cialdini Application**
- ❌ "Only 3 spots left!" (false scarcity)
- ✅ "We cap cohorts at 12 businesses for personalized attention" (authentic scarcity)
