## BrandScript for [BRAND NAME]

---

### 1. A Character (The Customer's Desire)

**What does your customer want?**

Define the singular, specific desire that drives their actions. This must be:
- Specific and tangible (not vague)
- Relevant to survival, relationships, or meaning
- Expressed in customer language

**Guiding Questions**:
- What do they want related to your offering?
- What's the surface-level desire (before you dig deeper)?
- How do they describe this want in their own words?

**Customer's Desire**:
[Write the specific desire in 1-2 sentences]

---

### 2. Has a Problem (The Three-Dimensional Villain)

The customer can't achieve their desire because they face a three-level problem.

#### External Problem (The Tangible Obstacle)

**What is the surface-level, physical problem they face?**

This is what they initially think is the problem—the concrete, measurable obstacle.

**External Problem**:
[Write the external problem in 1 sentence]

**Examples**:
- Not enough leads
- Can't find time to work out
- Don't know which investments to choose

---

#### Internal Problem (The Real Villain)

**How does the external problem make them FEEL?**

This is the frustration, self-doubt, or fear caused by the external problem. This is what they REALLY care about.

**Guiding Questions**:
- What emotion does the external problem create?
- What does this problem make them question about themselves?
- What self-doubt or frustration is churning inside?

**Internal Problem**:
[Write the internal problem in 1 sentence focusing on emotion/self-doubt]

**Examples**:
- "I feel incompetent as a business owner"
- "I feel like I'm failing my family's health"
- "I feel stupid and overwhelmed"

---

#### Philosophical Problem (The Deeper Injustice)

**Why shouldn't it be this way?**

This is the sense of injustice—the "this shouldn't be so hard" frustration. It positions the brand as fighting alongside the customer.

**Formula**: "It shouldn't be this [hard/unfair/complex] for [type of person] to [achieve desire]"

**Philosophical Problem**:
[Write the philosophical problem in 1 sentence]

**Examples**:
- "It shouldn't be this hard for great businesses to thrive"
- "Your career shouldn't force you to sacrifice your health"
- "Financial freedom shouldn't require a finance degree"

---

### 3. And Meets a Guide (The Brand as Wise Mentor)

You must demonstrate TWO qualities to be a trusted guide:

#### Empathy (Understanding)

**How do you show you understand their struggle?**

Use the formula: "We know what it's like to [specific struggle]"

**Empathy Statement**:
[Write 1-2 sentences showing understanding of their problem]

**Examples**:
- "We know how frustrating it is when you invest in marketing that doesn't convert"
- "We've been there—staring at empty calendars wondering where your next client will come from"

---

#### Authority (Competence)

**What evidence proves you can help them succeed?**

Choose 2-3 authority signals (don't overwhelm):
- Track record: "After helping [number] [customers]..."
- Credentials: "Certified by [authoritative body]"
- Testimonials: Specific customer success
- Awards: "Featured in [credible publication]"
- Longevity: "[X] years of proven results"

### 4. Who Gives Them a Plan (The Path Forward)

The plan reduces perceived complexity and risk. Choose ONE type:

#### Option A: Process Plan (Steps to Engage)

A simple 3-4 step outline of how to work with you.

**Process Plan**:
1. [Step 1 - Clear action customer takes]

### 5. And Calls Them to Action (The Invitation)

You need TWO types of calls to action:

#### Direct CTA (High-Commitment Action)

The primary action that moves them into a transaction.

**Characteristics**:
- High commitment (purchase, sign contract, paid service)
- Should be bold and prominent
- Action-oriented verb (Schedule, Start, Get, Join)

**Direct CTA**:
[Write your direct call to action]

**Examples**:
- "Schedule Your Free Strategy Session"

---

#### Transitional CTA (Low-Commitment Entry Point)

The trust-building action that provides value without purchase.

**Transitional CTA**:
[Write your transitional call to action]

**Examples**:

### 6. That Helps Them Avoid Failure (The Stakes)

**What happens if they DON'T take action?**

Paint a specific picture of negative consequences. This creates urgency.

**Guidelines**:
- Be realistic (not fear-mongering)
- Connect to internal problem (emotional stakes)
- Make it tangible and specific
- Use sparingly (don't be all doom-and-gloom)

**Failure/Stakes Description**:
[Write 2-4 sentences describing consequences of inaction]

**Examples**:

"Without a consistent lead generation system, you'll continue burning time on ineffective tactics, watching competitors grow while you plateau. That frustration and self-doubt will keep growing."

"If you keep deprioritizing fitness, six months from now you'll still be in the same place—tired, guilty, and watching your health decline. Your kids will learn that work comes first, always."

---

### 7. And Ends in a Success (The Transformation)

**What does the customer's life look like AFTER achieving their desire?**

Paint a vivid, aspirational picture. This is the "happily ever after."

**Use BAB (Before-After-Bridge) structure**:

#### Before (Current Frustrated State)
[Brief reminder of current pain]

#### After (Aspirational Transformed State)
[Vivid picture of life post-transformation]

Include:
- External success (tangible outcomes)
- Internal success (emotional transformation)
- Unexpected benefits (ripple effects)
- Identity shift (who they become)

#### Bridge (How Brand Facilitates)
[Brief mention of how your solution makes this real]

---

**Success Vision**:
[Write 3-5 sentences painting vivid transformation picture]

**Examples**:

"Imagine waking up to a calendar full of qualified leads—prospects who actually want what you offer. You'll feel confident as a business owner, knowing your marketing system works predictably. No more feast-or-famine. No more questioning your competence. Just consistent, sustainable growth while you focus on what you love: serving clients."

"Picture this: You complete your workout before your first meeting. Every single day. You're energized, not exhausted. Your kids start asking to 'exercise with you' in the mornings. And when you look in the mirror, you see someone who prioritizes health—not out of obligation, but because it's now your identity."
