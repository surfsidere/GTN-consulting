# Brand DNA Discovery Template

**Purpose**: Strategic foundation questionnaire to uncover authentic brand identity before any copywriting.

**Principle**: Discover values, don't invent them. The strongest brand messaging comes from honest excavation of what already exists.

---

## Mission Discovery Framework

### Guiding Questions

**1. Why does this business exist beyond making money?**

Prompt for depth:
- "If this business disappeared tomorrow, what would be lost in the world?"
- "What problem would remain unsolved?"
- "What transformation would not happen?"

**Validation Criteria**:
- ✅ Aspirational (points to change, not just transaction)
- ✅ Specific (not "help people" but "help X achieve Y")
- ✅ Action-oriented (uses verbs like "enable," "transform," "unlock")
- ❌ Profit-focused ("maximize shareholder value")
- ❌ Generic ("be the best")
- ❌ Feature-based ("provide innovative solutions")

**Example Good Missions**:
- "Enable small business owners to compete with enterprise-level marketing capabilities"
- "Transform how distributed teams collaborate asynchronously across time zones"
- "Unlock financial literacy for first-generation wealth builders"

---

## Vision Discovery Framework

### Guiding Questions

**1. If this mission succeeds completely, what does the world look like in 5-10 years?**

Prompt for specificity:
- "How many people are affected?"
- "What measurable changes occur in their lives?"
- "What becomes possible that wasn't before?"

**2. What future state are you building toward?**

Prompt for visualization:
- "Paint a vivid picture of a day in your ideal customer's life after full transformation"
- "What shifts in the industry or society?"

**Validation Criteria**:
- ✅ Measurable future state (numbers, outcomes, behaviors)
- ✅ Emotionally compelling (inspires action)
- ✅ Achievable but ambitious (10x, not 2x thinking)
- ❌ Vague platitudes ("change the world")
- ❌ Internally-focused ("be a billion-dollar company")
- ❌ Unclear timeline (no "someday" visions)

**Example Good Visions**:
- "By 2030, 100,000 small businesses have the marketing sophistication of Fortune 500 companies, creating 50,000 new jobs in their communities"
- "Within 5 years, asynchronous collaboration is the default for knowledge work, eliminating timezone-based hiring discrimination"

## Core Values Discovery Framework

### Guiding Principles

**Purpose**: Identify 3-5 behavioral principles that dictate decision-making and differentiate from competitors.

**Anti-Pattern**: Generic industry values
- ❌ "Integrity" (every business should have this)
- ❌ "Customer-focused" (table stakes)
- ❌ "Innovation" (meaningless without specificity)

**Ideal Pattern**: Unique, ownable, behavioral descriptors
- ✅ "Radical Transparency" (behavior: share financials publicly)
- ✅ "Relentless Iteration" (behavior: ship imperfect, improve daily)
- ✅ "Asymmetric Generosity" (behavior: give 10x before asking)

---

### Discovery Questions

**1. What behaviors are non-negotiable in how you operate?**

Examples:
- "We never compromise on [X], even if it costs more"
- "We always do [Y], even when it's inconvenient"
- "We refuse to [Z], even if competitors do it"

**2. What decisions have you made that confused outsiders but felt right internally?**

This reveals authentic values:
- "We turned down a huge client because they wanted us to [violate principle]"
- "We spent 3 months perfecting [detail] most competitors skip"

**3. When hiring, what traits are non-negotiable beyond skills?**

Cultural fit reveals core values:
- "We only hire people who [specific behavior]"
- "Red flag candidates who [specific anti-behavior]"

**4. What do customers say about you that competitors can't claim?**

External validation of values:
- "They say we're [unique descriptor]"
- "They're surprised when we [unexpected behavior]"

---

### Value Specificity Spectrum

**Level 1: Generic** (avoid)
- Quality
- Honesty
- Reliability

**Level 2: Industry-Standard** (insufficient differentiation)
- Customer-first
- Data-driven
- Innovative

**Level 3: Specific** (acceptable)
- Transparent pricing
- Evidence-based
- Fast iteration

**Level 4: Unique & Ownable** (ideal)
- Radically transparent (publish all metrics publicly)
- Obsessively evidence-based (no claims without citations)
- Ship-daily iteration (visible improvements every 24hrs)

**Goal**: Reach Level 3 minimum, strive for Level 4.

---

### Core Value → Behavior Mapping

For each value identified, define:

**Value Name**: [Unique descriptor]

**Behavioral Definition**: "This means we [specific action] even when [constraint]"

**Example Decision**: "We chose to [X] over [Y] because of this value"

**Customer-Visible Evidence**: "Customers experience this through [touchpoint]"

---

**Example Complete Core Value**:

**Value**: Asymmetric Generosity

**Behavioral Definition**: "We give 10x more value upfront than we ask in return, creating reciprocity through genuine service rather than manipulation"

**Example Decision**: "We offer a 90-day free trial with full feature access, while competitors offer 14 days with limited features"

**Customer-Visible Evidence**: "Customers receive our complete onboarding course ($2,000 value) before paying anything"

---

## Target Audience Psychographic Depth

### Beyond Demographics

**Demographic data** (age, income, location) is necessary but insufficient. Psychographic depth reveals motivations.

### Discovery Questions

**1. Pain Points & Frustrations**

"What keeps your ideal customer awake at 3am worrying?"

Prompt for layers:
- Surface pain: [What they say is the problem]
- Emotional pain: [How the problem makes them feel]
- Identity pain: [What the problem says about them]

**Example**:
- Surface: "I can't generate consistent leads"
- Emotional: "I feel overwhelmed and incompetent"
- Identity: "I'm failing as a business owner"

---

**2. Goals & Aspirations**

"What does your ideal customer secretly hope to achieve (beyond the obvious)?"

Prompt for stated vs. unstated goals:
- Stated goal: "Increase revenue"
- Unstated goal: "Prove I can succeed without corporate job safety net"

---

**3. Language & Metaphors**

"What exact phrases does your ideal customer use when describing their situation?"

Collect verbatim language:
- "I feel like I'm throwing spaghetti at the wall"
- "It's a constant hamster wheel"
- "I'm drowning in options but starving for results"

**Application**: Use their metaphors in copy for instant resonance.

---

**4. Current State vs. Desired State**

**Current State**: "Describe a typical frustrating day in their current reality"

**Desired State**: "Describe the transformed version of that same day"

**Gap Analysis**: "What specific capabilities or resources are missing that prevent the transition?"

---

## Competitor Messaging Analysis

### Differentiation Opportunity Framework

**1. Collect Competitor Messaging**

Audit 3-5 direct competitors:
- Homepage headlines
- Value propositions
- About page language
- Email subject lines

**2. Identify Patterns**

What do all competitors say?
- Common promises: [List recurring claims]
- Common language: [Overused phrases]
- Common positioning: [How they all position]

**3. Locate Gaps**

**Messaging Gaps**:
- What is no one talking about that matters to customers?
- What pain point is universally ignored?
- What transformation is under-communicated?

**Emotional Gaps**:
- What emotion are competitors triggering (or failing to trigger)?
- What aspirational identity are they missing?

**4. Define Differentiation Strategy**

"We will own [specific message] by emphasizing [unique angle] while competitors focus on [their common focus]"

**Example**:
"While competitors emphasize 'more leads,' we'll own 'qualified leads that actually close' by emphasizing match quality over volume"

---

## Offer Clarification Framework

### Product/Service Definition

**Beyond Features**: Define the transformation, not just the mechanism.

**Feature-Focused** (insufficient):
"Our platform includes CRM, email automation, and analytics"

**Transformation-Focused** (ideal):
"Our platform enables you to nurture leads automatically, know exactly when to call, and close 3x more deals in the same time"

---

### Transformation Articulation

**Template**:
"We help [target audience] go from [current frustrated state] to [desired transformed state] through [unique mechanism]"

**Example**:
"We help small business owners go from sporadic, unpredictable leads to a consistent pipeline of qualified prospects through our 3-step organic attraction system"

---

## Success Metrics Definition

### Measurement Framework

**Copywriting Success Metrics** (must be specific and measurable):

**Direct Response**:
- Conversion rate increase: [X%]
- Click-through rate: [Y%]
- Email open rate: [Z%]

**Engagement**:
- Time on page: [N seconds]
- Scroll depth: [% of page]
- Bounce rate reduction: [X%]

**Business Outcomes**:
