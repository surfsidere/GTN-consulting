# Classical Copywriting Formulas Reference
## Tactical Execution Frameworks

**Purpose**: Proven copywriting formulas for specific communication goals, each with structure, use cases, and examples.

**Principle**: Choose formula based on goal, not preference. Each formula solves a specific persuasion challenge.

---

## Formula 1: PAS (Problem-Agitate-Solution)

### Structure

**P - Problem**: State the issue clearly and concisely
**A - Agitate**: Amplify the emotional impact of the problem
**S - Solution**: Present the brand as the guide who solves it

### When to Use

**Ideal for**:
- Email subject lines
- Social media posts
- Landing page opening sections
- StoryBrand "Problem" section

**Goal**: Create urgency by making the problem feel immediate and painful

### Psychological Mechanism

**Why it works**: Loss aversion—humans are more motivated to solve pain than pursue gain. PAS activates this primitive response.

---

### Formula Application

**Step 1: Problem (State It)**

Be specific and concrete. Use customer language.

**Examples**:
- ❌ Vague: "Marketing is hard"
- ✅ Specific: "You're spending $2K/month on ads that generate zero qualified leads"

---

**Step 2: Agitate (Make It Hurt)**

Add emotional layers. Connect to internal problem (self-doubt, frustration, fear).

**Techniques**:
- **Quantify the waste**: "That's $24K per year down the drain"
- **Future project**: "At this rate, you'll burn through your runway in 6 months"
- **Identity threat**: "You're starting to question if you're cut out for this"
- **Competitive anxiety**: "Meanwhile, your competitors are growing"

**Examples**:
- ❌ Weak agitation: "This isn't ideal"
- ✅ Strong agitation: "Every month without a lead system is another month watching your best competitors pull ahead while you're stuck on the hamster wheel"

---

**Step 3: Solution (Position as Guide)**

Introduce the brand as the helper, not the hero. Focus on transformation, not features.

**Formula**: "[Brand] helps [customer type] [achieve desire] by [unique mechanism]"

**Examples**:
- ❌ Feature-focused: "Our platform has CRM integration and automation"
- ✅ Transformation-focused: "Our Simple Lead System helps small business owners generate 15+ qualified leads per week using our proven 3-step framework"

---

### Complete PAS Examples

**Example 1: Email Subject Line**

**Problem**: "Your calendar is empty next week"
**Agitate**: (Implied in recipient's mind: "I might not hit my goals")
**Solution**: "Here's how to fill it with qualified leads"

---

**Example 2: Social Media Post**

**Problem**: "Spent $5K on Facebook ads last quarter. Got 3 leads that didn't convert."

**Agitate**: "That gut-punch feeling when you check your ROI? Yeah, we know it. You're working harder than ever, but your lead pipeline looks like a desert. And that voice in your head is getting louder: 'Maybe I'm just not good at marketing.'"

**Solution**: "Here's the truth: You don't suck at marketing. The system does. We've helped 500+ small business owners escape this exact trap. Want the playbook? Link in bio."

---

**Example 3: Landing Page Opening**

**Problem**:
"Lead generation feels like throwing spaghetti at the wall. Some months you're feast, others you're famine. It's exhausting."

**Agitate**:
"Every morning you wake up wondering if today's the day a qualified lead finally shows up. You've tried Facebook ads ($2K burned), cold email (crickets), networking events (time sink), and 'growth hacking' (whatever that means). Nothing sticks.

The worst part? Watching competitors who aren't even as good as you somehow have calendars full of clients. It's not fair. And you're starting to question if you're cut out for this."

**Solution**:
"Here's what we've learned after helping 500+ small businesses crack the lead generation code: It's not about working harder. It's about having a system that works while you sleep.

Our Simple Lead System is a 3-step framework that attracts qualified leads organically—no ads, no cold outreach, no burnout. In 90 days, you'll have a predictable pipeline. Guaranteed."

---

### PAS Pitfalls to Avoid

❌ **Over-agitation**: Don't fear-monger or catastrophize unrealistically
❌ **Agitation without empathy**: Feels manipulative; lose trust
❌ **Vague problem**: "Things aren't working" is too general
❌ **Feature-heavy solution**: List features instead of transformation

✅ **Best Practices**:
- Keep problem specific and relatable
- Agitate with authentic emotional truth
- Solution focuses on customer transformation
- Transition smoothly (don't jump abruptly to "buy now")

---

## Formula 2: BAB (Before-After-Bridge)

### Structure

**B - Before**: Describe the current frustrated state
**A - After**: Paint the aspirational transformed state
**S - Bridge**: Explain how the brand facilitates the journey

### When to Use

**Ideal for**:
- StoryBrand "Success" section
- Testimonial framing
- Case studies
- Vision-casting sections

**Goal**: Create desire through vivid visualization of transformation

### Psychological Mechanism

**Why it works**: Humans make decisions emotionally, then rationalize logically. BAB triggers emotional desire first, then provides logical bridge.

---

### Formula Application

**Step 1: Before (Current State)**

Paint a vivid, frustrating "day in the life" before transformation.

**Techniques**:
- Use sensory details (what do they see, feel, hear?)
- Include time stamps ("It's 11pm on Sunday...")
- Add internal monologue ("You're thinking: 'There has to be a better way'")
- Be specific (not "busy," but "answering 47 unqualified emails")

**Examples**:
- ❌ Generic: "You're stressed about leads"
- ✅ Vivid: "It's Tuesday morning. You open your empty calendar. Again. Three networking events last week. Five hours on LinkedIn. Zero qualified leads. You're starting to wonder if your business model is broken."

---

**Step 2: After (Transformed State)**

Contrast with equally vivid "day in the life" after transformation.

**Techniques**:
- Mirror the "before" structure (same time of day, same frustrations → resolved)
- Show external AND internal transformation
- Include unexpected benefits (ripple effects)
- Make it emotionally compelling, not just practically better

**Examples**:
- ❌ Flat: "You have more leads"
- ✅ Vivid: "Now it's Tuesday morning. You open your CRM to 14 new qualified leads—business owners who found your content and raised their hands. You schedule three strategy calls before breakfast. No hustle. No desperation. Just consistent, predictable growth. And that voice questioning your competence? Silent."

---

**Step 3: Bridge (The Mechanism)**

Explain HOW the transformation happens—the unique process, system, or methodology.

**Formula**: "Here's how we take you from [before] to [after]: [3-step process]"

**Principles**:
- Keep it simple (3-4 steps maximum)
- Use concrete action verbs
- Show customer agency ("You'll," not "We'll")
- Connect to brand's unique methodology

**Examples**:
- ❌ Vague: "We use our proprietary system"
- ✅ Clear: "Here's how we take you from lead drought to consistent pipeline:
  1. We analyze your expertise and ideal client to create a Lead Magnet they can't resist
  2. You attract qualified prospects through our organic content framework (no ads needed)
  3. Our automated nurture sequence turns interested leads into booked calls—while you sleep"

---

### Complete BAB Examples

**Example 1: SaaS Marketing Tool**

**Before**:
"Right now, you're on the marketing hamster wheel. Every week feels like starting from zero. You post on LinkedIn (7 likes, no leads). You attend networking events (lots of handshakes, no follow-through). You check your CRM and see… tumbleweeds. The worst part? You know you're great at what you do. You just can't figure out how to attract the clients who need you."

**After**:
"Imagine this: You wake up to 10 new qualified leads who found your content and requested a consultation. Your calendar is full two weeks out. You're turning down low-fit clients because you have options. You're no longer the business owner 'bad at marketing'—you're the CEO who cracked the code. And the best part? You're working fewer hours because the system runs itself."

**Bridge**:
"Here's how our Simple Lead System creates this transformation:

**Step 1 - Lead Magnet Creation**: We help you package your expertise into an irresistible resource your ideal client can't scroll past.

**Step 2 - Organic Attraction**: Using our content framework, you attract qualified prospects through value-first outreach (no ads, no cold DMs).

**Step 3 - Automated Nurture**: Our sequence turns interested leads into booked calls automatically—even while you're sleeping.

In 90 days, you go from feast-or-famine to predictable pipeline."

---

**Example 2: Fitness App**

**Before**:
"Every Sunday night, you promise yourself: 'This week I'll get to the gym.' Monday arrives. Emergency at work. Tuesday you're exhausted. Wednesday the gym closes before you leave the office. By Friday, you've abandoned the goal—again. You feel guilty, frustrated, and stuck. Your health keeps taking the backseat to everything else."

**After**:
"Now? You complete your workout before your first meeting—every single day. No gym commute. No equipment. Just 20 minutes in your living room, and you're done. Your energy is through the roof. You've dropped 15 pounds in 12 weeks. And here's the unexpected part: Your kids started asking to 'work out with you' in the mornings. You're not just transforming your body—you're modeling health for your family."

**Bridge**:
"Here's how FitQuick makes this real:

**Step 1 - Personal Assessment**: Our AI analyzes your fitness level and creates a custom 20-minute routine (no guesswork).

**Step 2 - Daily Micro-Workouts**: Every morning, we send you that day's workout—bodyweight only, follow-along videos, impossible to mess up.

**Step 3 - Streak Building**: Our gamification system makes you want to keep going. After 7 days, you won't want to break the chain.

In 30 days, fitness becomes your new normal—no willpower required."

---

### BAB Pitfalls to Avoid

❌ **Unrealistic "after"**: Promising transformation that's not achievable
❌ **Weak contrast**: Before and after feel too similar
❌ **Complicated bridge**: Process has 10 steps and confuses
❌ **Feature-focused bridge**: Explain technical specs instead of customer experience

✅ **Best Practices**:
- Before and after should be emotionally contrasting
- After includes unexpected benefits (ripple effects)
- Bridge is 3-4 simple, customer-centric steps
- Use sensory, specific language (not abstract concepts)

---

## Formula 3: AIDA (Attention-Interest-Desire-Action)

### Structure

**A - Attention**: Hook with compelling headline
**I - Interest**: Develop curiosity and relevance
**D - Desire**: Build emotional want and aspiration
**A - Action**: Clear, specific call-to-action

### When to Use

**Ideal for**:
- Full sales pages
- Long-form landing pages
- Email sequences (1 email = 1 AIDA component)
- Video sales letters

**Goal**: Guide prospect through complete persuasion journey from cold → hot

### Psychological Mechanism

**Why it works**: Mirrors the natural decision-making process—you must capture attention before you can persuade. Each stage prepares the next.

---

### Formula Application

**Step 1: Attention (The Hook)**

Goal: Stop the scroll. Make them read the next sentence.

**Techniques**:
- **Shocking stat**: "87% of small businesses fail due to this one marketing mistake"
- **Bold claim**: "What if you could generate leads without spending a dollar on ads?"
- **Direct challenge**: "Still wasting money on marketing that doesn't convert?"
- **Curiosity gap**: "The lead generation secret no one talks about"

**Headline Formula Options**:
- "How to [Desired Outcome] Without [Common Obstacle]"
- "[Number] Reasons Why [Belief] Is Dead Wrong"
- "The Secret to [Desire] That [Authority] Don't Want You to Know"
- "What [Aspiration Identity] Know About [Topic] That You Don't"

**Examples**:
- ❌ Boring: "Lead Generation Services for Small Businesses"
- ✅ Attention-Grabbing: "Generate 15+ Qualified Leads Per Week Without Spending a Dollar on Ads"

---

**Step 2: Interest (Develop Relevance)**

Goal: Prove this message is for them. Build curiosity about how it works.

**Techniques**:
- **Qualify the reader**: "If you're a small business owner tired of feast-or-famine lead flow..."
- **Amplify the problem**: "You've tried Facebook ads ($5K burned), cold email (crickets), networking events (time drain)..."
- **Tease the solution**: "What if there was a system that attracted qualified leads organically—while you sleep?"
- **Story hook**: "Three years ago, I was exactly where you are..."

**Structure**:
```
[Attention headline]

↓

If you're [target audience] struggling with [specific problem], this is for you.

You've probably tried [failed solution 1], [failed solution 2], and [failed solution 3].

None of them worked because [why conventional approaches fail].

What if [teaser of unconventional solution]?

That's exactly what I'm about to show you.
```

---

**Step 3: Desire (Build Emotional Want)**

Goal: Make them want the transformation viscerally.

**Techniques**:
- **Success vision (BAB)**: Paint vivid "after" state
- **Social proof**: "Join 500+ business owners who've transformed their lead gen"
- **Authority building**: Credentials, case studies, testimonials
- **Unique mechanism**: "Our proprietary 3-Step Simple Lead System"
- **Contrast**: Before/after, us/them, old way/new way

**Structure**:
```
Imagine [vivid success vision using BAB formula]...

That's the transformation our [unique system name] creates.

Here's how it works: [3-step bridge]

Don't just take my word for it. Here's [Customer Name]:

[Testimonial with specific results]

This is possible for you too.
```

---

**Step 4: Action (Drive the CTA)**

Goal: Remove friction and get commitment.

**Techniques**:
- **Direct CTA**: "Schedule Your Free Strategy Session Now"
- **Risk reversal**: "90-day money-back guarantee—if you don't see 15+ leads, full refund"
- **Urgency (authentic)**: "We cap onboarding at 10 clients/month. 3 spots left this month."
- **Simplify next step**: "Click the button. Fill out 3 questions. We'll email your custom roadmap."

**CTA Language Principles**:
- Use action verbs: Schedule, Start, Get, Join, Claim
- State clear value: "Free," "Guaranteed," "No Risk"
- Keep friction low: "No credit card required," "Cancel anytime"
- Repeat 3-5 times on page (above fold, mid-page, bottom, sticky button)

**Structure**:
```
Ready to [achieve desire] without [obstacle]?

[Direct CTA Button: "Schedule Your Free Strategy Session"]

Here's what happens next:
1. [Simple step 1]
2. [Simple step 2]
3. [Simple step 3]

### Complete AIDA Example: Sales Page

**ATTENTION (Headline Section)**:

```
Generate 15+ Qualified Leads Per Week
Without Spending a Dollar on Ads

The proven system 500+ small business owners use to build predictable pipelines—organically.
```

---

**INTEREST (Problem Amplification Section)**:

```
If you're a small business owner stuck on the marketing hamster wheel, this is for you.

You've tried:
→ Facebook ads ($5K burned, zero qualified leads)
→ Cold email outreach (99% ignore rate)
→ Networking events (hours invested, no follow-through)
→ "Growth hacking" (whatever that means)

None of them worked because they're designed for big brands with big budgets—not scrappy businesses like yours.

What if there was a system that attracted your ideal clients organically—using the expertise you already have?

That's exactly what the Simple Lead System does.
```

---

**DESIRE (Transformation + Proof Section)**:

```
Imagine this: You wake up to 12 new qualified leads in your CRM—business owners who found your content and raised their hands. You schedule three strategy calls before breakfast. No hustle. No ad spend. Just consistent, predictable growth.

Your calendar is full two weeks out. You're turning down low-fit clients because you have options. You're no longer the business owner "bad at marketing"—you're the CEO who cracked the code.

That's the transformation our Simple Lead System creates.

Here's how it works:

**Step 1 - Lead Magnet Creation**: We help you package your expertise into an irresistible resource your ideal client can't scroll past.

**Step 2 - Organic Attraction**: Using our content framework, you attract qualified prospects through value-first outreach (no ads, no cold DMs).

**Step 3 - Automated Nurture**: Our sequence turns interested leads into booked calls automatically—while you sleep.

---

Don't just take my word for it. Here's Sarah Chen, founder of CloudSync Consulting:

> "Before Simple Lead System, I was spending $3K/month on Facebook ads and getting maybe 2-3 qualified leads. In 90 days with this system, I generated 47 qualified leads—organically. My cost per lead went from $1,000 to $0. And I'm working half the hours on marketing."

**Sarah's results**: 47 qualified leads in 90 days | $0 ad spend | 23 new clients

---

This is possible for you too.
```

---

**ACTION (CTA Section)**:

```
Ready to Build Your Predictable Lead Pipeline?

[CTA Button: "Schedule Your Free Strategy Session"]

Here's what happens next:
1. You book a 30-minute strategy session (free, no pitch)
2. We analyze your current lead gen and identify the #1 bottleneck

### AIDA Email Sequence Application

**Email 1 (Attention + Interest)**:
- Subject: "The lead gen secret no 'guru' talks about"
- Body: Hook + problem amplification + teaser
- CTA: Transitional (download free resource)

**Email 2 (Interest + Desire)**:
- Subject: "Why Facebook ads failed you (it's not your fault)"
- Body: Explain why conventional methods fail + introduce unique mechanism
- CTA: Transitional (watch demo video)

**Email 3 (Desire)**:
- Subject: "From 2 leads/month to 47 leads in 90 days (Sarah's story)"
- Body: Case study with BAB structure + social proof
- CTA: Soft direct (schedule strategy session)

**Email 4 (Action)**:
- Subject: "Ready to build your predictable pipeline?"
- Body: Direct ask + risk reversal + urgency
- CTA: Direct (schedule now)

---

### AIDA Pitfalls to Avoid

❌ **Weak attention**: Generic headline that doesn't stop scroll
❌ **Skipping interest**: Jump from attention → desire too fast
❌ **All logic, no emotion**: Build interest but not desire
❌ **Passive CTA**: "Consider signing up" instead of "Schedule Now"
❌ **Too many CTAs**: 5 different asks create decision paralysis

✅ **Best Practices**:
- Each stage prepares the next (don't skip)
- Attention must be specific and bold
- Interest qualifies reader (make them feel seen)
- Desire uses emotion (BAB, social proof, vision)
- Action removes all friction (guarantees, simple next step)

---

## Formula 4: 4Ps (Promise-Picture-Proof-Push)

### Structure

**P1 - Promise**: Bold benefit statement
**P2 - Picture**: Visualize the transformation
**P3 - Proof**: Evidence of authority/credibility
**P4 - Push**: Compelling call-to-action

### When to Use

**Ideal for**:
- StoryBrand Guide, Success, and CTA sections
- Ad copy (especially Facebook/LinkedIn)
- Video sales letters
- Webinar presentations

**Goal**: Make a bold claim, prove it's achievable, drive action

### Psychological Mechanism

**Why it works**: Combines aspiration (Promise + Picture) with credibility (Proof) and urgency (Push) in rapid sequence. Creates momentum toward decision.

---

### Formula Application

**Step 1: Promise (Bold Benefit)**

Make a specific, measurable claim about the transformation.

**Formula**: "[Customer type] [achieves specific outcome] in [timeframe]"

**Principles**:
- Be bold but believable
- Quantify when possible
- Focus on outcome, not process
- Use customer language

**Examples**:
- ❌ Vague: "Improve your marketing"
- ✅ Specific: "Small business owners generate 15+ qualified leads per week in 90 days"

**More Examples**:
- "Busy professionals get fit in 20 minutes per day—no gym required"
- "First-time investors build a diversified portfolio in 48 hours—no finance degree needed"
- "Service providers book their calendar full in 60 days—without spending a dollar on ads"

---

**Step 2: Picture (Visualize It)**

Paint a vivid, sensory image of the promise fulfilled.

Use BAB "After" techniques:
- Sensory details (what they see, feel, hear)
- Unexpected benefits (ripple effects)
- Identity shift (who they become)

**Examples**:

**Lead Gen Promise → Picture**:
"Imagine opening your CRM every Monday to 15 new qualified leads—business owners who found you, read your content, and raised their hands to work together. No cold outreach. No ad spend. Just consistent, predictable growth while you focus on what you love: serving clients."

**Fitness Promise → Picture**:
"Picture this: You finish your workout before your first coffee. You're energized, not exhausted. Your kids start asking to 'exercise with you' in the mornings. And when you look in the mirror, you see someone who prioritizes health—not because you have to, but because it's now your lifestyle."

---

**Step 3: Proof (Build Credibility)**

Provide evidence that the promise is achievable.

**Proof Types** (choose 2-3):
- **Social proof**: "500+ small business owners use this system"
- **Testimonials**: "[Customer] generated 47 leads in 90 days"
- **Case studies**: Detailed before/after with numbers
- **Credentials**: "Certified by [authority]," "Featured in [publication]"
- **Track record**: "After 15 years and 10,000+ clients..."
- **Unique methodology**: "Our proprietary 3-Step Simple Lead System"

**Examples**:

**Lead Gen Proof**:
"Over 500 small business owners have transformed their lead generation using the Simple Lead System. Here's what Sarah Chen achieved in just 90 days:
→ 47 qualified leads (organically)
→ $0 ad spend
→ 23 new clients
→ 3x revenue growth"

**Fitness Proof**:
"FitQuick has helped 10,000+ busy professionals reclaim their health. Our method is backed by peer-reviewed research on micro-workout effectiveness, and our trainers hold advanced certifications in functional movement and nutrition science.

Here's Mike Rodriguez's transformation:
→ Lost 18 pounds in 12 weeks
→ Completed workouts 6 days/week (vs. 0 before)
→ Energy levels '10x higher'
→ Kids now exercise with him every morning"

---

**Step 4: Push (Drive Action)**

Create urgency and remove friction.

**Push Techniques**:
- **Direct CTA**: Clear, action-oriented instruction
- **Risk reversal**: "90-day money-back guarantee"
- **Authentic urgency**: "10 client spots/month, 3 remaining"
- **Scarcity**: "Course closes Friday"
- **Bonus/incentive**: "First 20 get free implementation session"

**Examples**:

**Lead Gen Push**:
"Ready to build your predictable lead pipeline?

### 4Ps Pitfalls to Avoid

❌ **Weak promise**: Too vague or unbelievable
❌ **No picture**: Skip visualization, just state facts
❌ **Insufficient proof**: One weak testimonial, no data
❌ **Passive push**: "Consider signing up" instead of urgency

✅ **Best Practices**:
- Promise must be specific and bold (but believable)
- Picture uses sensory, emotional language
- Proof includes numbers and real customer names
- Push creates genuine urgency (limited spots, bonuses)

## Advanced Techniques

### Formula Stacking

Combine formulas within single piece of copy for maximum impact.

**Example: Landing Page Hero Section**

```
[4Ps Promise]
"Small business owners generate 15+ qualified leads per week in 90 days"

[BAB Picture]
"Imagine opening your CRM to find 15 new leads who actually want what you offer..."

[PAS Problem]
"Right now, you're burning $3K/month on ads that don't convert..."

[4Ps Proof + Push]
"500+ businesses have made this real. Ready to join them?
[CTA: Schedule Free Session]"
```

---

### Formula Adaptation by Channel

**Social Media (Character Limit)**:
- Use **PAS (condensed)**: Problem in first sentence, agitate in second, solution in third
- Example tweet: "Spending $5K/month on ads with zero ROI? That's $60K/year down the drain. Here's the system 500+ businesses use to generate leads organically: [link]"

**Email Subject Lines**:
- Use **PAS (P only)**: State problem as curiosity hook
- Example: "Your calendar is empty next week" (recipient agitates themselves)

**Video Sales Letters**:
- Use **AIDA (full)**: Each section = 2-3 minute segment
- Structure: Hook (Attention) → Story (Interest) → Testimonials (Desire) → Offer (Action)

---
