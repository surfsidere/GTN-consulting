# StoryBrand 7-Part (SB7) Framework
## Complete Narrative Architecture Guide

**Source**: Donald Miller, "Building a StoryBrand" (2017)

**Core Principle**: Customers don't buy the best products; they buy the ones they can understand the fastest. Clarity wins.

**Fundamental Truth**: The customer is the hero of the story, and the brand is the wise guide who helps them win the day.

---

## The Story Gap Problem

**Why Most Marketing Fails**:
Most businesses position themselves as the hero of the story:
- "We are the leader in..."
- "Our innovative solutions..."
- "We have 20 years of experience..."

**Psychological Reality**:
Humans are wired to see themselves as the hero of their own story. When a brand positions itself as the hero, customers subconsciously resist because there's only room for ONE hero in a story.

**Solution**:
Use the StoryBrand 7-Part Framework to position the customer as the hero and the brand as the guide.

---

## The 7-Part Framework

Every compelling story follows this structure:

1. **A Character** (The Hero = Customer)
2. **Has a Problem** (External, Internal, Philosophical)
3. **And Meets a Guide** (The Brand with Empathy + Authority)
4. **Who Gives Them a Plan** (Process or Agreement)
5. **And Calls Them to Action** (Direct + Transitional CTAs)
6. **That Helps Them Avoid Failure** (The Stakes)
7. **And Ends in a Success** (The Transformation)

---

## Part 1: A Character

### Purpose
Define what the customer wants—their singular, driving desire.

### Psychological Foundation
Stories begin when a character wants something specific. Without a clear desire, there's no story to tell.

### Application in Marketing
The customer's desire must be:
- **Specific**: "I want to lose 20 pounds" not "I want to be healthy"
- **Relevant to survival**: Safety, resources, relationships, meaning
- **Surface-level**: Don't go too deep initially; start with obvious desire

### Common Mistakes
❌ Defining multiple desires (confuses the narrative)
❌ Making the desire too philosophical (loses immediacy)
❌ Assuming the desire (explicitly state it)

### Examples

**SaaS Marketing Tool**:
"Small business owners want to attract more qualified leads without expensive advertising"

**Fitness App**:
"Busy professionals want to stay fit without spending hours at the gym"

**Financial Planning**:
"First-generation wealth builders want to invest confidently without needing a finance degree"

### Implementation in Copy

**Homepage Headline Formula**:
"[Desired Outcome] Without [Common Obstacle]"

Examples:
- "Generate Qualified Leads Without Wasting Ad Budget"
- "Get Fit in 20 Minutes Without Leaving Home"
- "Build Wealth Without Complex Financial Jargon"

---

## Part 2: Has a Problem

### Purpose
Define the three-dimensional problem preventing the hero from achieving their desire.

### The Three Levels of Conflict

#### Level 1: External Problem (The Villain)
The tangible, surface-level obstacle.

**Characteristics**:
- Physical or logistical barrier
- Objective and measurable
- What the customer initially thinks is the problem

**Examples**:
- Not enough leads
- Can't find time to work out
- Don't know which investments to choose

---

#### Level 2: Internal Problem (The Real Villain)
The frustration, self-doubt, or emotional struggle caused by the external problem.

**Psychological Truth**: Customers buy solutions to internal problems, not external ones.

**Characteristics**:
- Emotional and subjective
- Creates self-identity friction
- The *feeling* the external problem creates

**Formula**: "The external problem makes me feel [frustration/doubt/fear]"

**Examples**:
- **External**: Not enough leads
  **Internal**: "I feel incompetent as a business owner"

- **External**: Can't find time to work out
  **Internal**: "I feel like I'm failing my family's health"

- **External**: Don't know which investments to choose
  **Internal**: "I feel stupid and overwhelmed"

**Critical Insight**: The internal problem is the REAL story driver. This is what customers actually care about.

---

#### Level 3: Philosophical Problem (The Deeper Why)
The sense of injustice or wrongness—the "shouldn't be this way" feeling.

**Characteristics**:
- Moral or ethical dimension
- Universal truth being violated
- Resonates beyond individual customer

**Formula**: "It shouldn't be this hard/unfair/broken for [type of person] to [achieve desire]"

**Examples**:
- **External**: Not enough leads
  **Internal**: Feeling incompetent
  **Philosophical**: "It shouldn't be this hard for good businesses to thrive"

- **External**: Can't find time to work out
  **Internal**: Feeling like failing family
  **Philosophical**: "Your career shouldn't force you to sacrifice your health"

- **External**: Don't know which investments
  **Internal**: Feeling stupid/overwhelmed
  **Philosophical**: "Financial freedom shouldn't require a finance degree"

**Why This Matters**: The philosophical problem positions the brand as fighting for justice alongside the customer.

---

### Problem Articulation in Copy

**Three-Level Problem Stack** (use in About pages, email sequences):

```
You're struggling with [External Problem].

This makes you feel [Internal Problem emotion/self-doubt].

Here's the truth: [Philosophical "it shouldn't be this way" statement].

That's where we come in.
```

**Example (SaaS Marketing Tool)**:

```
You're struggling to generate consistent, qualified leads.

This makes you feel like you're failing as a business owner—questioning whether you have what it takes.

Here's the truth: It shouldn't be this hard for great businesses to attract their ideal customers.

That's where we come in.
```

---

## Part 3: And Meets a Guide

### Purpose
Position the brand as the wise mentor (think Yoda, not Luke Skywalker).

### The Two Essential Qualities

#### Quality 1: Empathy
Demonstrate understanding of the customer's problem.

**Formula**: "We understand what it's like to [specific struggle]"

**Examples**:
- "We know how frustrating it is when you invest in marketing that doesn't convert"
- "We've been there—staring at empty calendars wondering where your next client will come from"
- "We remember that feeling of overwhelm when every 'guru' gives different advice"

**Key Principle**: Empathy builds trust. Authority without empathy feels arrogant.

---

#### Quality 2: Authority
Provide evidence of competence without arrogance.

**Authority Signals** (choose 2-3, don't overwhelm):
- Track record: "After helping 500+ businesses..."
- Credentials: "Certified by [authoritative body]"
- Testimonials: "Here's what [customer] achieved..."
- Awards/Recognition: "Featured in [credible publication]"
- Longevity: "15 years of proven results"
- Unique methodology: "Our proprietary 3-step system"

**Examples**:
- "After helping 500+ small businesses scale their lead generation, we've identified the exact patterns that work"
- "Our trainers hold advanced certifications in functional movement and nutrition science"
- "We've managed over $50M in client investments with a 93% satisfaction rate"

**Key Principle**: Authority builds confidence. Empathy without authority feels nice but ineffective.

---

### Empathy + Authority Balance

**The Guide Positioning Formula**:
"We understand [empathy statement] because we've [authority credential]. That's why we created [unique solution]."

**Example**:
"We understand how overwhelming marketing can feel for small business owners because we've helped 500+ navigate this exact challenge. That's why we created our Simple Lead System—proven strategies without the complexity."

---

### Common Mistakes

❌ **Too much authority, not enough empathy**: Comes across as arrogant
❌ **Too much empathy, not enough authority**: Feels wishy-washy, not credible
❌ **Brand-as-hero language**: "We are the best..." instead of "We understand you and know how to help"
❌ **Generic credentials**: "20 years of experience" without specificity

---

## Part 4: Who Gives Them a Plan

### Purpose
Reduce the perceived complexity and risk of working with the brand.

### Psychological Barrier
Even when customers want what you offer AND trust you as a guide, they often don't engage because the path forward feels unclear or risky.

**The Plan removes confusion and fear.**

### Two Types of Plans

#### Type 1: Process Plan (How to Engage)
A simple 3-4 step outline of how to work with the brand.

**Formula**: "Step 1 → Step 2 → Step 3 → Result"

**Examples**:

**SaaS Tool**:
1. Schedule free strategy session
2. Receive custom lead generation plan
3. Implement with our guided support
4. Watch qualified leads flow in

**Fitness App**:
1. Download app and take fitness assessment
2. Get personalized 20-minute workout plan
3. Follow daily routines (we'll remind you)
4. See results in 30 days

**Financial Planning**:
1. Book complimentary portfolio review
2. Receive clear investment strategy
3. Start building wealth with ongoing guidance
4. Achieve financial confidence

**Key Principles**:
- Keep it to 3-4 steps (more creates overwhelm)
- Use active verbs
- Make the outcome explicit

---

#### Type 2: Agreement Plan (Alleviating Fears)
A list of principles or guarantees that address common objections.

**Formula**: "You can trust us because [principle/guarantee 1, 2, 3]"

**Examples**:

**SaaS Tool Agreement Plan**:
- ✅ No long-term contracts—cancel anytime
- ✅ 90-day money-back guarantee
- ✅ Your data is never sold or shared

**Fitness App Agreement Plan**:
- ✅ No gym equipment required
- ✅ Beginner-friendly (no prior experience needed)
- ✅ Cancel subscription with one click

**Financial Planning Agreement Plan**:
- ✅ Fiduciary duty (we're legally bound to act in your interest)
- ✅ Transparent fees—no hidden costs
- ✅ You own your investments (not locked in)

**Key Principles**:
- Address top 3 fears/objections
- Use positive framing ("We do X" not "We don't do Y")
- Make it tangible and specific

---

### When to Use Which Plan

**Use Process Plan when**:
- The engagement process is unclear to customers
- Multiple touchpoints are involved
- Onboarding has complexity

**Use Agreement Plan when**:
- Trust is a major barrier (financial, health, personal data)
- Industry has reputation problems (shady practices)
- Customers have been burned before

**Pro Tip**: You can use BOTH plans together for maximum clarity and trust.

---

## Part 5: And Calls Them to Action

### Purpose
Give customers clear, specific actions to take at every stage of engagement.

### Psychological Truth
Customers do not take action unless explicitly invited. Even interested, qualified prospects need a clear CTA.

### Two Types of CTAs

#### Type 1: Direct CTA (Buy Now)
The primary, high-commitment action that moves customers into a transaction.

**Characteristics**:
- High commitment (purchase, sign contract, schedule paid service)
- Should be bold and prominent
- Repeated throughout customer journey

**Examples**:
- "Schedule Your Free Strategy Session"
- "Start Your 90-Day Free Trial"
- "Buy Now and Save 20%"
- "Book Your Consultation"

**Placement**:
- Above the fold (homepage)
- Navigation bar
- End of every page/email
- Sidebar or sticky footer

**Language Principles**:
- Action-oriented verbs (Schedule, Start, Get, Join)
- Clear value ("Free," "Save," "Guaranteed")
- Urgency when authentic ("Limited Spots," "Sale Ends Friday")

---

#### Type 2: Transitional CTA (Nurture)
The low-commitment entry point that builds trust and provides value.

**Purpose**: Capture leads who aren't ready to buy but are interested.

**Characteristics**:
- Low/no commitment (free download, watch video, read guide)
- Provides genuine value
- Moves prospect closer to purchase decision

**Examples**:
- "Download Our Free Lead Generation Checklist"
- "Watch the 5-Minute Demo Video"
- "Read the Complete Buyer's Guide"
- "Join Our Free Weekly Newsletter"

**Placement**:
- Secondary CTA buttons (less prominent than Direct CTA)
- Blog post opt-ins
- Exit-intent popups
- Email signature

**Language Principles**:
- Emphasize "free" or "no obligation"
- Specify deliverable ("Checklist," "Guide," "Video")
- Quick consumption ("5-Minute," "One-Page")

---

### CTA Strategy

**Homepage Structure**:
- **Hero Section**: Direct CTA (primary button)
- **Mid-Page**: Transitional CTA (secondary offer)
- **Footer**: Direct CTA again (repetition)

**Email Sequence**:
- **Email 1**: Transitional CTA (build trust with free resource)
- **Email 2**: Transitional CTA (educational content)
- **Email 3**: Direct CTA (now ask for purchase)

**Landing Page**:
- **Single Direct CTA** repeated 3-5 times
- No navigation (reduce decision fatigue)
- Sticky CTA button follows scroll

---

### Common CTA Mistakes

❌ **Vague CTAs**: "Learn More," "Click Here" (no clear value)
❌ **Too many CTAs**: 5+ different actions creates decision paralysis
❌ **Hidden CTAs**: Small, unclear, buried at bottom of page
❌ **No transitional option**: Asking for purchase without trust-building step
❌ **Passive language**: "Consider scheduling" instead of "Schedule Now"

---

## Part 6: That Helps Them Avoid Failure

### Purpose
Clarify the negative consequences of inaction to create urgency.

### Psychological Principle
**Loss aversion**: Humans are more motivated to avoid pain than gain pleasure.

### What to Avoid
❌ Fear-mongering or manipulation
❌ Exaggerated catastrophizing
❌ Negative-only messaging (must balance with success vision)

### What to Do
✅ State realistic, specific consequences
✅ Connect to internal problem (emotional stakes)
✅ Make it relatable and tangible
✅ Use sparingly (1-2 places, not entire message)

---

### The Three Levels of Failure

Mirror the three levels of problems:

#### External Failure
The tangible negative outcome.

**Examples**:
- "Continue wasting budget on ineffective marketing"
- "Keep missing workouts and losing progress"
- "Watch your money sit in low-return savings"

---

#### Internal Failure
The emotional consequence.

**Examples**:
- "Feel that gnawing self-doubt about your business skills"
- "Carry guilt about neglecting your health"
- "Experience anxiety about financial future"

---

#### Philosophical Failure
The deeper injustice.

**Examples**:
- "Accept that great businesses fail due to bad marketing systems"
- "Resign yourself to the myth that health requires huge time investment"
- "Stay trapped by financial complexity designed to exclude you"

---

### Failure Articulation in Copy

**Formula (use in sales pages, email sequence Email 2)**:

```
Without [solution], you'll continue [external failure], which means [internal failure].

The truth is: [philosophical failure statement].

But it doesn't have to be this way.
```

**Example**:

```
Without a proven lead system, you'll continue burning time and budget on tactics that don't work, which means you'll keep questioning whether you're cut out for this.

The truth is: Talented business owners shouldn't have to fail because marketing is unnecessarily complex.

But it doesn't have to be this way.
```

---

### Placement Strategy

**Where to use "Avoid Failure" messaging**:
- Sales page: Middle section (after establishing value, before final CTA)
- Email sequence: Email 2 (after empathy, before transformation)
- Webinar: Transition point (problem → solution)

**Where NOT to use**:
- Homepage hero section (start with aspiration, not fear)
- First email in sequence (build trust first)
- Social media (too heavy for channel)

---

## Part 7: And Ends in a Success

### Purpose
Paint a vivid, aspirational picture of the hero's transformed life after achieving their desire.

### Psychological Foundation
**Visualization creates motivation**. When customers can see their transformed self, they're compelled to act.

### The Three Levels of Success

Mirror problems and failures:

#### External Success
The tangible positive outcome.

**Examples**:
- "Calendar full of qualified leads"
- "Fitting into clothes you love"
- "Portfolio growing steadily"

---

#### Internal Success
The emotional transformation.

**Examples**:
- "Confidence as a business owner"
- "Pride in prioritizing health"
- "Financial peace of mind"

---

#### Philosophical Success
The restoration of justice.

**Examples**:
- "Proof that great businesses can thrive with the right system"
- "Living evidence that health doesn't require sacrifice"
- "Demonstration that financial freedom is accessible"

---

### Success Articulation in Copy

**Use BAB (Before-After-Bridge) Formula**:

**Before**: Current frustrated state
**After**: Aspirational transformed state
**Bridge**: How the brand facilitates the transformation

**Template**:

```
Imagine waking up to [external success], feeling [internal success emotion], knowing that [philosophical success].

That's the transformation we create for [customer type].

Here's how: [bridge to product/service]
```

**Example (SaaS Marketing Tool)**:

```
Imagine waking up to a calendar full of qualified leads—prospects who actually want what you offer.

You'll feel confident as a business owner, knowing your marketing system works predictably.

And you'll be living proof that great businesses can thrive when they have the right tools.

That's the transformation our Simple Lead System creates for small business owners.

Here's how: Our 3-step process turns your expertise into a lead magnet that attracts ideal clients automatically.
```

---

### Success Visualization Techniques

**Technique 1: Day-in-the-Life Narrative**

Paint a detailed picture of a specific day post-transformation.

**Example**:
"Picture this: It's Tuesday morning. You open your CRM and see 12 new qualified leads who requested demos. You schedule three calls for the afternoon—knowing each one is genuinely interested because they found YOU. No cold outreach. No expensive ads. Just consistent, predictable attraction."

---

**Technique 2: Aspiration al Identity Shift**

Show how the transformation changes their self-concept.

**Example**:
"You're no longer the business owner who 'isn't good at marketing.' You're the CEO who's cracked the code—who other business owners ask for advice."

---

**Technique 3: Comparative Contrast**

Juxtapose old life vs. new life vividly.

**Example**:
| Before | After |
|--------|-------|
| Sporadic leads, feast or famine | Predictable pipeline, steady growth |
| Questioning your competence | Confident in your system |
| Wasting budget on failed tactics | Investing in proven strategies |

---

### Placement Strategy

**Where to use "Success Vision"**:
- Homepage: Hero section subheadline
- Sales page: Opening section (hook immediately)
- Email sequence: Final email (right before CTA)
- Testimonials: Customer success stories embody this

**Pro Tip**: Combine customer testimonials with success vision to make it tangible and credible.

---
