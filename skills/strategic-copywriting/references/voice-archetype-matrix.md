# Voice Archetype Matrix
## Core Values → Linguistic Rules Mapping

**Purpose**: Translate abstract core values into concrete linguistic techniques for consistent brand voice.

**Principle**: Voice is not "tone"—it's the systematic application of language rules that reflect core values.

---

## The Voice Authenticity Problem

**Common Failure Pattern**:
Companies say their values are "innovative" and "customer-focused," then write copy that sounds identical to every competitor.

**Root Cause**: Values remain abstract. No translation into specific writing rules.

**Solution**: Map each core value to concrete linguistic techniques.

---

## Core Value Translation Framework

For each core value, define:

1. **Linguistic Rules**: Specific writing techniques
2. **Sentence Structure**: Length, complexity, rhythm
3. **Word Choice**: Vocabulary tier, jargon level, metaphor types
4. **Formatting**: Visual emphasis techniques
5. **Examples**: Before/after transformations

## Multi-Archetype Blending (Advanced)

**When to blend**: If your brand has conflicting values (e.g., "expert" + "approachable")

**How to blend**:
- **Primary archetype** (70%): Dominates sentence structure and overall tone
- **Secondary archetype** (30%): Adds nuance through word choice and specific examples

**Example: Sage (70%) + Jester (30%)**

Pure Sage:
"Research indicates that 87% of businesses experience lead generation challenges. The optimal solution involves systematic process improvement."

Pure Jester:
"Lead gen sucks for basically everyone. (We checked—it's science. Kinda.) Want the fix?"

Sage + Jester Blend:
"Here's the data: 87% of businesses struggle with lead generation. (Yeah, it's basically everyone.) But research shows a systematic approach works. No BS—just proven strategies."
